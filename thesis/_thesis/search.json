    "text": "1.1 Rationale\nAlthough the UK is, by global standards, a wealthy nation with relatively high life expectancy, the country still suffers vast inequalities in mortality. While there have been studies on trends in subnational life expectancy in England, these have been limited in resolution to the district level (Bennett et al., 2015). There is vast heterogeneity in health outcomes and their determinants within districts. As a notable example of mortality from recent years, Kensington and Chelsea, which contains both the most affluent areas in the country in its south and some of the poorest in its north, was the district containing the Grenfell Tower tragedy in 2017. There is a clear need to uncover further variation in mortality below the district level.\nSince around 2010, although national life expectancy has continued to increase, there is evidence that the rise in female life expectancy has reversed in the most deprived deciles of the population (Bennett et al., 2018; Marmot et al., 2020). There are likely to be important changes in the cause-specific composition of mortality that have driven this reversal.\nThe title of this thesis is adapted from Mathers et al. (2005): Counting the dead and what they died from: an assessment of the global status of cause of death data."

Chapter 5 extends the first objective by focussing on London at a finer scale than the previous chapter as an attempt to gauge whether higher resolution analyses are possible. Chapter 6 addresses objective two of this thesis, breaking down total mortality in England into specific causes of deaths at a coarser scale, and looking at potential drivers for the observed trends in life expectancy.

    "section": "2.2 Small area health statistics (unit)",
    "text": "2.2 Small area health statistics (unit)\nIn 1983, a documentary on the fallout from a fire at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria claimed that there was a ten-fold increase in cases of childhood leukaemia in the surrounding community. This anomaly had gone undetected by public health authorities, raising concern that routinely collected data were not able to identify local clusters of disease. The subsequent enquiry confirmed the excess, and recommended that a research unit was set up to monitor small area statistics and respond quickly to ad hoc queries on local health hazards. The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) was established in 1987 (Elliott et al., 1992).\nBeyond producing substantive research on environment and health, a core aim of SAHSU is to develop small area statistical methodology (Wakefield and Elliott, 1999) for:\n\nPoint source type studies. Is there an increased risk close to an environmental hazard?\nGeographic correlation studies. Is there a correlation between disease risk and spatially-varying environmental variables?\nClustering. Does a disease produce non-random spatial patterns of incidence? If the aetiology is unknown, this could suggest the disease is infectious.\nDisease mapping. Summarising the spatial variation in risk.\n\nIn a pilot study for SAHSU, Elliott et al. (1992) investigated the mortality near the Plymouth docks from mesothelioma and asbestosis – both of which are related to industrial exposure and asbestos. Death registrations with postcode information were held by SAHSU, and concentric circular bands were drawn around the Plymouth dockyards as a way to approximate the exposure from a point source of environmental pollution. There was a clear increase in risk within 3km of the docks. A similar distance-based approach was adopted to look at excess respiratory disease mortality near two factories in Barking and Havering (Aylin et al., 1999), and kidney disease mortality near chemical plants in Runcorn (Hodgson et al., 2004). In response to public concern over exposure to toxic chemicals in waste materials, SAHSU conducted the most extensive study ever into the health effects of landfill sites. Postcodes within a 2km buffer of a landfill site were classified as exposed. Compared to those living beyond 2km, SAHSU found a small unexplained excess of congenital anomalies (Elliott et al., 2001a), no increase in rates of cancer (Jarup et al., 2002b), and no excess risk of Down syndrome (Jarup et al., 2007).\nDistance from source is, however, only a basic model for the exposure, which can exhibit more complex, directional spatial patterns. A number of SAHSU studies have employed physics-informed models to create an exposure surface, and assessed the geographic correlations between this surface and the health outcome, notably for a plume of mercury pollution (Hodgson et al., 2007), exposure to mobile phone base stations during pregnancy (Elliott et al., 2010), noise from aircraft near Heathrow (Hansell et al., 2013), road traffic noise in London (Halonen et al., 2015), and particulate matter from incinerators during pregnancy (Parkes et al., 2020). SAHSU published an environment and health atlas for England and Wales, showing the spatial patterns of 14 health conditions at census ward level over an aggregated 25 year period alongside five environmental exposure surfaces (Hansell, Anna L. et al., 2014).\n\nDisease mapping at SAHSU\nMany of the studies at SAHSU focus on prevalence or mortality from rare diseases at small areas. The number of cases, or number of deaths, in a region are likely to be small numbers. This sparseness issue is even more pertinent when the population is further stratified by age group. Rates calculated from observed data present apparent variability between spatial units, which is larger than the true differences in risk. There is a need for statistical smoothing techniques to obtain robust estimates of rates by sharing information between strata. Aylin et al. (1999) mapped diseases for wards in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster using a simple model that smoothed rates towards the mean risk across the region. Thereafter, SAHSU published a plethora of studies for disease mapping models with explicit spatial dependence, which are designed to give more weight to nearby areas than those further away.\nThere are three main categories for modelling spatial effects. First, we can treat space as a continuous surface using Gaussian processes or splines. Second, we can use areal models, which make use of the spatial neighbourhood structure of the units. Thirdly, we can explicitly build effects based on a nested hierarchy of geographical units, for example between state, county and census tract in the US.\n\nSpace as a continuous process\nIn the context of disease mapping, events are usually aggregated to areas rather than assigned specific geographical coordinates. Wakefield and Elliott (1999) model aggregated counts as realisations of a Poisson process, in which the expected number of cases is calculated by integrating a continuous surface that generates the cases over the area of the spatial unit. The surface was a function of spatially-referenced covariates. Kelsall and Wakefield (2002) describe an alternative model, where the log-transformed risk surface is modelled by a Gaussian process, whose correlation function depends on distance.\nBest et al. (2005) provide a review of the use of hierarchical models with spatial dependence for disease mapping. In particular, the authors focus on Bayesian estimation, and different classes of spatial prior distributions.\nThe first prior proposed for spatial effects \\(\\mathbf{S} = {S_1, ..., S_n}\\) is the multivariate normal \\[\n\\mathbf{S} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\pmb{\\mu}, \\pmb{\\Sigma}),\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\pmb{\\mu}\\) is the mean effect vector, \\(\\pmb{\\Sigma} = \\sigma^2 \\pmb{\\Omega}\\) and \\(\\pmb{\\Omega}\\) is a symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix defining the correlation between spatial units. A common choice when specifying the structure of the correlation matrix is to assume a function that decays with the distance between the centroids of the areas, so that places nearby in space share similar disease profiles. Note, this is mathematically equivalent to the practical implementation of a Gaussian process, which uses a finite set of points. An example in Elliott et al. (2001b) chooses an exponential decay function to map cancer risk in northwest England.\n\n\nSpace as discrete units\nA more popular prior is the conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior, also known as a Gaussian Markov random field. These form a joint distribution as in Equation 2.1, but the covariance is usually defined instead in terms of the precision matrix \\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\pmb{\\Sigma}^{-1} = \\tau(\\mathbf{D} - \\rho \\mathbf{A}),\n\\tag{2.2}\\] where \\(\\tau\\) controls the overall precision of the effects, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the spatial adjacency matrix formed by the small areas, \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is a diagonal matrix with entries equal to the number of neighbours for each spatial unit, and the autocorrelation parameter \\(\\rho\\) describes the amount of correlation. This can be seen as tuning the degree of spatial dependence, where \\(\\rho = 0\\) implies independence between areas, and \\(\\rho = 1\\) full dependence. The case with \\(\\rho = 1\\) is called the intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model. Besag et al. (1991) proposed the model (hereafter called BYM) \\[\nS_i = U_i + V_i,\n\\tag{2.3}\\] where \\(U_i\\) follow an ICAR distribution, and \\(V_i\\) are independent and identically distributed random effects. The BYM distribution was employed to model spatial variation in the relative risk of testicular (Toledano et al., 2001) and prostate (Jarup et al., 2002a) cancers for small areas in regions of England.\nFurther disease mapping studies at SAHSU using spatially structured effects have also extended the methodology to look at age patterns and trends over time. Asaria et al. (2012) analysed cardiovascular disease death rates by fitting a spatial model for all wards in England separately for each age group and time period. Bennett et al. (2015) designed a model to jointly forecast all-cause mortality for districts in England, age groups and years. The model used BYM spatial effects and random walk effects over age and time to capture non-linear relationships. It is also possible to borrow information across causes of death, as applied in Foreman et al. (2017) to forecast cause-specific mortality for states in the US. Random walk effects were again used for temporal non-linearities, a CAR prior was used for spatial effects, and a multivariate normal prior for causes of death whereby the covariance matrix describes the correlation structure between the 15 cause groups. The model did not, however, share information between age groups.\n\n\nSpace as a nested hierarchy of geographies\nThe relationships between different levels of a hierarchy of geographical units are often incorporated into models as a nested hierarchy of random effects. These models account for when spatial units lie within common administrative boundaries. This is often a desirable property of the model for certain geographies, like states in the US, which are administrative. Policy is decided at these geographies, so there is reason to believe these boundaries may have a greater effect on health outcomes than spatial structure. Although not used in previous SAHSU studies, Finucane et al. (2014) demonstrate how country-level blood pressure can be modelled by exploiting the hierarchy global, subregion, region and country. Note, although these models group by geographical region, these models are not spatial as they do not contain any information on the relative position of the areas."

    "text": "2.3 Small area analyses of mortality\nIn order to compare the health status between areas, health authorities require a measure of mortality that collapses age-specific information into a single number. Indirectly standardised measures such as the standardised mortality ratio – the ratio between total deaths and expected deaths in an area – are easy to calculate, but are not easily understood by laypeople. Directly standardised methods, in contrast, require knowledge of the full age structure of death rates rather than just the total number of deaths. Age-standardised death rates, however, suffer the same interpretability issue as the standardised mortality ratio, and are only comparable between studies if the same reference population is used. An alternative choice is life expectancy. Silcocks et al. (2001) explain that life expectancy is a “more intuitive and immediate measure of the mortality experience of a population, [and] is likely to have greater impact… than other measures that are incomprehensible to most people.”\nThe estimation of death rates requires two data sources: deaths counts and populations. Modern death registration systems are complete and accurate. On the other hand, although usually treated as a known quantity, the population denominator is often problematic. Populations for small geographies are only recorded during a decennial census, and estimates are generated for the years in-between using limited survey data on births, deaths and migration. And although the census is considered the “gold standard”, it is subject to enumeration errors, particularly for areas with special populations such as students or armed forces (Elliott et al., 2001b).\nBeyond the population issue, finer scale studies are restricted by data availability. Where data are available, there is still the need to overcome small number issues before feeding death rates through the life table to calculate life expectancy. Eayres and Williams (2004) recommend a minimum population size of 5000 when using traditional life table methods, below which the calculation of life expectancy is unstable1, or the error estimates become so large that any comparison between subgroups becomes meaningless. One approach, often taken by statistical agencies, is to build larger populations by either aggregating multiple years of data (Bahk et al., 2020; Office for National Statistics, 2015; Public Health England, 2021) or combining spatial units (Ezzati et al., 2008). Here, we focus on studies using Bayesian hierarchical models to generate robust estimates of age-specific death rates by recognising the correlations between spatial units and age groups, which produce more accurate estimates for small population studies of life expectancy (Congdon, 2009; Jonker et al., 2012).\nJonker et al. (2012) demonstrated the advantages of the Bayesian approach for 89 small areas in Rotterdam using a joint model for sex, space and age effects, finding a 8.2 year and 9.2 year gap in life expectancy for women and men. Stephens et al. (2013) employed the same model for 153 administrative areas in New South Wales, Australia.\nBayesian spatial models for mortality have been scaled to small areas for entire countries, and also consider trends in these regions over time. Bennett et al. (2015) forecasted life expectancy for 375 districts in England and Wales using a spatiotemporal model trained over a 31 year period, and Dwyer-Lindgren et al. (2017a) explored mortality trends 3110 US counties from 1980 to 2014.\nThere have also been studies on specific cities at a finer resolution. In order to improve estimates for disability-free life expectancy, Congdon (2014) considered both ill-health and mortality in a joint likelihood with spatial effects for 625 wards in London, finding more than a two-fold variation in the percent of life spent in disability for men. Bilal et al. (2019) looked at 266 subcity units for six large cities in Latin America. As there is no contiguous boundary in this case, a random effects model for each city was used instead of a spatial model. The largest difference between the top and bottom decile of life expectancy at birth was 17.7 years for women in Santiago, Chile.\nTwo studies in North America have looked below the county level, at census tracts, with wide-ranging population sizes as small as 40. Dwyer-Lindgren et al. (2017b), using a model that relied heavily on sociodemographic covariates, studied trends for life expectancy and many causes of death for 397 tracts in King County, Washington, uncovering an 18.3 year gap in life expectancy for men. Using the same model for Vancouver, Canada, Yu et al. (2021) found widening inequalities over time and a difference of 9.5 years for men."

    "section": "2.4 Mortality by specific causes of death (counting what they died from)",
    "text": "2.4 Mortality by specific causes of death (counting what they died from)\nIn the mid-twentieth century, a team in the US Public Health Service, led by Iwao Moriyama, began looking into the cause-specific composition of mortality into all diseases and injuries for the first half of the century. Notably, Moriyama and Gover (1948) grouped vital registration data into primary causes, and found as the US saw an overall downward trend in mortality, the leading causes of death changed from communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis and diphtheria, toward non-communicable, “chronic diseases of older ages”, such as heart diseases and cancers. The success of the reduction – and in the case of typhoid fever, near-elimination – of infectious diseases was attributed to the strategy of the health officer in the early 1900s, who was focussed on improving water and sanitation, and public health interventions such immunisation and quarantines.\nBy comparing vital registration data over several centuries, Abdel Omran observed this shift of mortality from communicable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in many countries (Omran, 1977, 1971). Although the pace and determinants of the transition varied between countries, Omran formalised three common successive stages of the shift in mortality:\n\nThe Age of Pestilence and Famine. Mortality is high and largely governed by malthusian “positive checks” – epidemics, famines, and wars.\nThe Age of Receding Pandemics. Mortality decreases as epidemics become less frequent, but infectious diseases remain the leading causes of death.\nThe Age of Degenerative and Man-made diseases. Mortality declines further along with fertility, increasing the average age of population and NCDs take over as the leading causes of death.\n\nHe termed this the Epidemiologic Transition theory. Omran (1971) explained that England and Wales took the classic transition path followed by western societies, whereby socioeconomic factors such as improvements to living standards are crucial in causing easily preventable diseases to subside and shifting towards the third phase of the transition, and medical and other public health technology only help society much later in the final stage. Later, Olshansky and Ault (1986) would propose a fourth stage to the theory, the Age of Delayed Degenerative Diseases, in which the structure of causes of death is stable, but the age at which degenerative diseases kill is postponed, thus decreasing older age mortality. There are, however, questions around the universality and unidirectionality of the theory, with many examples in which age-specific death rates for population subgroups have risen over time, most notably the HIV/AIDS pandemic (Gaylin and Kates, 1997). Gersten and Wilmoth (2002) also criticise the lack of attention Omran’s theory pays towards the role of infection in chronic and degenerative diseases, in particular certain cancers.\nAround the same time as Omran, Samuel Preston collated cause-specific mortality data for a huge number of populations, spanning 48 nations and nearly a century (Preston, 1970; Preston and Nelson, 1974). This would enable international comparisons of groups of causes of death over different time periods, and a deeper understanding of the upward trends in life expectancy. In particular, by plotting cause-specific disease rates against overall mortality, Preston and Nelson (1974) saw that, over time, the contribution of infectious diseases to a particular level of mortality had become ever smaller. That is to say, as mortality declined, the contribution from infectious diseases also declined. Preston attributed this to an accelerating rate of medical progress guided by the “germ theory of disease”, which public health and science were not able to replicate for NCDs. Preston also traced the excess deaths in older males observed in western societies to cardiovascular diseases, cancer and bronchitis – a direct result of dramatic increases in cigarette smoking (Preston, 1970).\nSince its first edition in 1990, the subject of international comparisons of the cause-specific composition of mortality has been the remit of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies (Murray and Lopez, 1996). The studies aim to quantify and compare the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors, usually through cross-sectional methods but occasionally by examining trends and subnational populations (Dwyer-Lindgren et al., 2017a; Ezzati et al., 2008). An important innovation of the GBD study was the introduction of a hierarchical classification of groups of causes, with the broadest level divided into three groups: communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional diseases (Group 1), NCDs (Group 2), and injuries (Group 3). Salomon and Murray (2002) made use of the wide-ranging dataset and grouping from the GBD to revisit the epidemiologic transition for the second half of the twentieth century, finding the majority of the change in cause structure occurred among children, with a shift from Group 1 to Groups 2 and 3, and in young adults, where the role of injuries is more dominant for men."

    "section": "2.5 Health inequalities in the UK",
    "text": "2.5 Health inequalities in the UK\nWhile the UK is, by global standards, a wealthy nation with relatively high life expectancy, and the breadth of health inequalities are nowhere near the extremes seen in many other countries, the nation suffers still vast, preventable inequalities in mortality and morbidity. Health inequalities can be reduced through progressive social and economic policies, but is important to estimate and understand differences in health outcomes between population subgroups to aid the design of such policies. There are several ways to stratify the UK population and compare inequalities between subgroups. Here, we focus on class, income, geography, and deprivation.\n\nClass and income inequality\nThe notion of class is prominent in UK society, but health outcomes between classes are difficult to separate from other risk factors such as hazards in manual labour or smoking rates. The Whitehall study of 1967 followed 17,530 men working in the civil service and recorded their mortality over a 10-year period. Marmot et al. (1984) found, by classifying the civil servants into social class according to their employment grade, there was a three-fold difference in mortality between the highest class, administrators, and men in the lowest class, mainly messengers and manual workers. They found, in general, a strong inverse association between grade and mortality – a term Marmot has coined a “social gradient”. The men were working stable, sedentary jobs in the same office building in London, so the gradient could not be explained industrial exposure alone, and the gradient remained even after controlling for smoking. The authors concluded there must be other factors inherent to social class (defined here by employment grade), which explain the mortality differences. A second cohort of Whitehall employees from 1985 to 1988, this time including women as well as men, were screened and asked to answer questions on self-reported ill-health. Marmot et al. (1991) found the social gradient in health had persisted in the 20 years separating the studies. In 2008, Marmot was asked by the Secretary of State to conduct a review into the state of health inequalities in the UK and to use the evidence to design policy for reducing these inequalities. A key plot in the first Marmot Review, released in 2010, depicted the social gradient in mortality for regions in England by socio-economic classification of employment (Marmot et al., 2010).\nIncome is not a routinely collected statistic in the UK. Nevertheless, using a small survey of 7000 people on three measures of morbidity, Wilkinson (1992) showed health improved sharply from the lowest to the middle of the income range.\n\n\nGeographical inequality\nIn 2015, the GBD Study released its first subnational estimates of mortality, starting with the UK and Japan. Steel et al. (2018) assessed these data, which divided the UK into 150 regions, finding mortality from all-causes varied twofold across the country, with the highest years of life lost in Blackpool and the lowest in Wokingham. In a study on forecasting subnational life expectancy in England and Wales, Bennett et al. (2015) estimated a 8.2 year range in life expectancy for men and 7.1 year range for women in 2012 between 375 districts. The lowest life expectancies were seen in urban northern England, and the highest in the south and London’s affluent districts. Within London itself, male and female life expectancy showed 5-6 years of variation.\n\n\nDeprivation\nThere have been substantial efforts in the UK to measure the deprivation of an area. Since 2004, the standard deprivation indicator in England has been the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) – a composite indicator for each Lower-layer Super Output Area (LSOA2) covering income, unemployment, health, crime and environmental data sources (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019). The Marmot Report presented life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy against IMD at the Middle-layer Super Output Area, which exhibit strong social gradients (Marmot et al., 2010). The GBD study found the 15 most deprived UTLAs had consistently raised mortality, especially for all causes, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Deprived UTLAs in London, such as Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Barking and Dagenham had lower rates of premature mortality than expected for that level of deprivation (Steel et al., 2018). Bennett et al. (2018) jointly estimated death rates by age, year and deprivation decile. They found since 2011, although national life expectancy has continued to increase, the rise in female life expectancy has reversed in the two most deprived deciles. The second Marmot Review in 2020 also found female life expectancy declined in the most deprived decile between the periods 2010-12 and 2016-18 (Marmot et al., 2020). Digging further into these trends by region, the report found this trend was seen in all regions except London, the West Midlands and the North West, and that male life expectancy in the bottom decile also decreased in the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the East of England.\n\n\nHealth policy in the UK\nSince the turn of the millennium, there have been two periods of contrasting health policy in the UK. The early 2000s saw the implementation of the English health inequalities strategy under New Labour, with explicit goals of reducing geographical inequalities in life expectancy. The strategy saw a large increase in public spending targeting the social determinants of health, with policies on supporting families, tackling deprivation, and preventative healthcare. Barr et al. (2017) analysed the trends in life expectancy for different quantiles of deprivation and provided evidence that the strategy achieved its aim of reducing the gap in life expectancy between the 20% most-deprived areas and the rest of the English population.\nFollowing the change in government in 2010, the strategy came to an end. The Conservative government implemented a widespread series of cuts to public services, collectively known as austerity. This included both tight restrictions on the healthcare budget as well as a sweeping reorganisation of the NHS in hope of improving the organisation’s efficiency, and cuts to the wider determinants of social health, such as housing and education (Ham, 2023). The cuts were geographically unequal, with reductions in funding for local governments particularly severe for local authorities with an old industrial base (Gray and Barford, 2018).\nThe study by Barr et al. (2017) saw that the trends in inequality reduction were reversing since 2012. These trends have been found at both ends of the life course: rising infant mortality associated with childhood poverty (Taylor-Robinson et al., 2019), and falls in female life expectancy at 65 and 85 (Hiam et al., 2018). Although it is difficult to uncover causal relationships, Alexiou et al. (2021) found strong associations between cuts to local government and the change in district-level life expectancy from 2013 to 2017. As written in the The New York Times, “after eight years of budget cutting, Britain is looking less like the rest of Europe and more like the United States, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty” (Goodman, 2018) – a comparison only compounded by the Brexit vote in 2016.\nPolicies of austerity were brought about as a response to the financial crash of 2008, which were global in scale, and many countries adopted similar fiscal strategies. This presented a double challenge for governments in high-income countries as the demand for care only continued to rise due to growing and ageing populations, with higher proportions of the populations suffering ill-health and complex multi-morbidities (Ham, 2023). However, in an international study comparing mortality trends in England and Wales to 22 industrialised countries, Leon et al. (2019) showed that although there was a general slowdown in improvement of life expectancy across many nations, the slowdown in the most recent period of the study, 2011-16, was more pronounced in England and Wales. More recently, The Economist found the same evidence, comparing the long-run trend from 1980-2011 through to 2022 for 12 European countries: “longer-run slowdowns in life expectancy are observable in other European countries… but none has stalled quite as much as Britain”(The Economist, 2023). And it’s not just life expectancy: the UK has performed worse as measured by cancer survival rates and infant mortality compared to other industrialised countries (OECD, 2016).\nAfter a decade of cuts, the UK entered the 2020s facing the greatest public health challenge for a generation: the Covid-19 pandemic. Unsurprisingly, England and Wales suffered one of the highest excess deaths tolls relative to other high-income countries (Kontis et al., 2020). At the current time of writing in 2023, the health service is yet to recover, with waiting lists for operations and waiting times for emergency care unhealthily high (Dorling, 2023). There is no suggestion that the picture of health and health inequalities in the UK should improve in the coming years.\nIt is important to estimate how health inequalities have changed in different areas of the country through this period of substantial change in economic, social, and healthcare policy, so that public health interventions can be targetted towards the most disadvantaged groups.\n\n\n\n\nAlexiou A, Fahy K, Mason K, Bennett D, Brown H, Bambra C, Taylor-Robinson D, Barr B. 2021.

    "section": "3.2 Counts of the dead",
    "text": "3.2 Counts of the dead\nThis thesis is primarily concerned with modelling death rates for small areas in England. This requires two data sources: counts of deaths, and populations counts. The counts of deaths come from de-identified civil registration data for all deaths in England from 2002 to 2019. In other words, every death in England from 2002 to 2019.\nThe data is extracted from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) database and held by SAHSU in a secure environment as individual death records are identifiable data. The data are updated every year and are mostly complete for previous years, but a handful of deaths are registered in later extracts if the ONS have been waiting on coroner’s report to identify the underlying cause of death.\nEach record comes with information on postcode of residence, allowing us to assign each death into a spatial unit for analysis. For each analysis, deaths were stratified into the following age groups: 0, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14, then 5-year age groups up to 80–84, and 85 years and older. There are also a series of ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes from the death certificate associated with the underlying and contributory causes leading to the death. Here, I focus only on the underlying cause of death, which has been assigned using selection algorithms to improve consistency between doctors (Office for National Statistics, 2022a).\nBefore fitting any models, it’s good practice to explore the data visually, in this case looking at how total mortality varies over different cross sections: sex, age, space, time.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Age-specific death rates in England from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nThe general age pattern, after aggregating all years and separating into age groups, follows a J-shape curve, with raised infant and older age mortality (Figure 3.1). Male mortality is higher at all ages, but particularly in young adulthood (15-29 years) due to injuries resulting from risky behaviour.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Age-specific death rates for broad age groups and life expectancy in England from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nFigure 3.2 looks at the trends over time for wider age groups. I did not use the 5-year age groups because the number of deaths for certain age groups at single years were small, and any data presented should be non-disclosive in accordance with SAHSU’s data sharing agreement. In general, death rates have decreased from 2002 to 2019 in all age groups, but with slowing progress in young adulthood and working ages (30-69 years). Likewise, life expectancy has improved throughout the study period, but has stalled since around 2010 for both sexes.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: District-level life expectancy for total death rates from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nFigure 3.3 shows the geography of life expectancy after aggregating deaths over the entire study period by district. For both sexes, the picture is similar: pockets of low life expectancy in the urban North West, North East, West Midlands, and coastal areas east of London.\nHere, I have taken slices across each dimension, but the aim in the following chapters is to calculate death rates for each sex-age-space-time stratum.\n\n3.2.1 Geographies of England\nHaving already introduced the term “district” in Figure 3.3, I’ll set out the lay of the land in terms of geographies used in this thesis. This thesis is concerned only with England, as Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each have their own separate deprivation data which are not comparable. The geographies in England form a nested hierarchy of spatial units from regions to districts to Middle-layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) to Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs). The number of units for each geography are summarised in Table 3.1.\n\n\nTable 3.1: The number of each geographical unit of England used in thesis and their populations in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeography\nNumber of units\nMedian (5th - 95th percentile) population in 2019\n\n\n\n\nregion\n9\n5,934,037 (3,536,336-9,092,877)\n\n\ndistrict\n314\n140,271 (68,238-380,483)\n\n\nMSOA\n6791\n7985 (5760–11,917)\n\n\nLSOA\n32844\n1620 (1235-2468)\n\n\n\n\nEngland is divided into 9 regions (London, North West, West Midlands, etc). Within these regions, there are 314 local authority districts. Districts are administrative geographies formed from a mixture of London boroughs, metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts, and unitary authorities. They are responsible for local policies, and are therefore subject to local government restructuring and boundary changes. To ensure geographic consistency, all data were mapped to the district boundaries from 2020.\nOutput Areas (OAs) are the smallest building block for spatial census statistics, with between 40 and 250 households and typically 100 to 625 people, and are designed to have some socioeconomic homogeneity. LSOAs are a type of census geography made up of around four or five OAs. MSOAs are then composed of around four or five LSOAs, and these MSOAs fit within district boundaries. OAs, LSOAs, and MSOAs are all statistical units are designed by the ONS purely for analysis purposes, so researchers can use spatial units with similar, but small, population sizes. No policies are created using these boundaries (Office for National Statistics, 2022b). Again, for geographic consistency, all data were mapped to the output area hierarchy from the 2011 census.\n\n\n3.2.2 Counts of the living\nThis second data sources we require are populations counts. These are taken from mid-year population estimates of the usual resident population by the ONS (Office for National Statistics, 2021a, 2021b). The ONS estimates inter-censal populations on a rolling basis, updating the previous year’s value using the change in the population in the GP patient registration data as an indicator of the true population change. The LSOA populations are fully consistent with estimates for higher levels in the nested geographical hierarchical including MSOAs, districts, regions and the national total for England (Office for National Statistics, 2021c).\n\n\n3.2.3 Deprivation data\nI used data for the following measures of socioeconomic deprivation from the English Indices of Deprivation:\n\nIncome deprivation (also referred to as poverty). The proportion of the geographical population claiming income-related benefits due to being out of work or having low earnings.\nEmployment deprivation (also referred to as unemployment). The proportion of the relevant population of the geography involuntarily excluded from the labour market due to unemployment, sickness or disability, or caring responsibilities.\nEducation, skills and training deprivation (also referred to as low education). Lack of attainment and skills, including education attainment levels, school attendance, and language proficiency indicators in the geographical population.\n\nThe above measures are the three largest contributors to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), excluding a domain on health that also uses mortality data. The data are produced at the LSOA level (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019).\nIMD data are not available for every year. The analysis period for the thesis is 2002 to 2019, so I used data for these measures for 2004, as data for 2002 were not available, and 2019. The 2004 data on deprivation domains were reported for LSOA boundaries from the 2001 census. I mapped these data to the 2011 census LSOA boundaries by assigning the 2001 LSOA score to all postcodes contained within it, then overlaying the 2011 LSOA boundaries, and averaging the score for all constituent postcodes of each LSOA, to obtain the corresponding score for each 2011 LSOA.\nThe definition of the indicators can change over time. Further, the indicator used for measuring education, skills and training deprivation (low education) is not directly interpretable because it combines multiple concepts and cannot be simply expressed as a proportion of the population. Therefore, I used ranking rather than scores so that comparisons can be made not only across spatial units in a single year, but also across the different years.\nThe deprivation data for geographies larger than LSOAs in Table 3.1 were created by ranking the population-weighted average of scores for all constituent LSOAs, as done previously for districts (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019).\n\n\n3.2.4 Migration data\nI also used estimates of population turnover, defined as the proportion of households in each LSOA in 2019 who were different from those who had lived there in 2002, from the Consumer Data Research Centre. The Consumer Data Research Centre estimates these proportions by using the names of households members, individually and in combination, and addresses and dates of records from electoral and consumer registers and land registry sales data (van Dijk et al., 2021). Estimates of population turnover for MSOAs were created by taking the mean across all constituent LSOAs (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019)."

    "text": "3.3 Modelling the dead\nFor each chapter, the quantity of interest is the same: mortality in each age group, spatial unit and year. Empirically, death rates can be calculated from observed data as the number of deaths divided by the population in each strata. Formally, using \\(a\\), \\(s\\), and \\(t\\) to index age, spatial unit and time, respectively, we write \\[\n\\hat{m}_{ast} = \\frac{\\text{deaths}_{ast}}{\\text{population}_{ast}},\n\\tag{3.1}\\] where \\(\\hat{m}_{ast}\\) is the empirical death rate.\nWhen the number of deaths becomes small, however, the empirical death rate presents an apparent variability from year to year, or from spatial unit to spatial unit, which is larger than the true differences in the risk of death. The problem is exacerbated for the young ages or rare diseases, where the number of deaths might be zero, or for smaller geographical units, where the population might be zero. As a demonstration, Figure 3.4 shows the expected and simulated number of deaths for a young age group (1-4 years) and an old age group (80-84). The simulation assumes the hypothetical spatial unit has a population of 1000 in each age group in each year, and generates deaths using a Poisson distribution and the national age-specific death rates for each year. Note, given the population sizes in Table 3.1, the true age-specific populations for LSOAs and MSOAs will be smaller and there will be even more zeros and even more noise in the number of deaths than in this simulation. Although there are a large number of deaths in the older age group and it is easy to visualise a curve that fits the data, the death counts for the young age group are extremely sparse and it is difficult to estimate the true underlying death rate. In this thesis, I have used Bayesian hierarchical models to obtain stable estimates of death rates by sharing information across age groups, spatial units, and years. An added advantage of the Bayesian paradigm is the robust estimation of error.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Simulated and expected deaths from 2002 to 2019 for a young age group (1-4 years) and an old age group (80-84), assuming the national death rates in England and a population size of 1000.\n\n\nThis is a regression task. We want to smooth over the data – the models aren’t being used for prediction. I tried to design a model that captures as much of the true variation in the data as possible using epidemiological knowledge to choose plausible effects. In other words, the model is “full”, with enough parameters to capture all the true variability. The downside of this approach is that models with more parameters are harder to fit, whereas models with fewer parameters, or parsimonious models, make Bayesian inference easier but can mask some of the variance."

    "text": "3.4 Inference\nThe decision was made early in the PhD to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods for inference, as this is the “gold standard” with guarantees that the sequence of samples will asymptotically converge to the true posterior. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art approximate inference package for spatial models, INLA, scales badly with the number of hyperparameters, and hence would struggle with the high dimensionality of the models in this thesis.\nBayesian models are specified in a probabilistic programming language. The starting point for this project was the NIMBLE package (de Valpine et al., 2022, 2017). NIMBLE uses the BUGS (“Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling”) syntax for defining a hierarchical model, which my research group has a lot of experience with as WinBUGS, one of the earliest software packages for Bayesian analysis, was developed largely in the department for use on SAHSU studies. NIMBLE has an R interface but compiles models to C++ for speed and scalability. It also increases the sampling efficiency by automatically finding conjugate relationships between parameters in the model and marginalising over them wherever possible. The group also has a close relationship with the lead developer of NIMBLE.\nNevertheless, Bayesian inference is difficult to scale, and some of the models in this thesis had in excess of \\(10^6\\) parameters and took NIMBLE between 10 and 14 days to collect enough posterior samples. One of the main issues with NIMBLE was that the vast majority of the parameters in the model could not exploit efficient conjugate samplers, and instead used variants of basic Metropolis-Hastings samplers, which, despite numerous efforts at tuning, were inefficient. Although NIMBLE could execute a reasonable number of samples per second, the MCMC chains were struggling to explore the posterior efficiently so the effective sample size per second was low. This is a common problem in spatial and spatiotemporal models, where the parameters are correlated by design. To overcome these mixing issues, the chains had to be run for longer and thinned (i.e. take every \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) sample so the Markov chain samples are closer to independent, which is better for computational reasons than storing a large number of correlated samples).\nI spent a lot of time trying different probabilistic programming languages across R, python and Julia, in particular packages that implemented the more efficient No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) (Rashid, 2022). In the end, I settled on NumPyro (Phan et al., 2019) because it was the fastest and inference could be performed on a GPU, rather than CPUs, which is more performant for large models (Lao et al., 2020). The major downside was that NumPyro had not been used extensively by the spatial modelling community so I had to implement the CAR distribution from Equation 2.2 myself, which has since been contributed to the source code (NumPyro documentation, 2023). Rewriting the model in NumPyro and sampling on a GPU cut the runtime down to around a day. NumPyro also has built-in methods for approximate variational inference, such as the Laplace approximation, but these failed to converge to sensible values for these models without heavy customisation of variational function, so I stuck with sampling methods."

    "title": "4  Small: Life expectancy trends in England at the MSOA level",
    "section": "4.1 Methods",
    "text": "4.1 Methods\n\n4.1.1 Mortality and population data\nI performed a high-­resolution spatiotemporal analysis of civil registration data in which I extracted de­-identified data for all deaths in England from 2002 to 2019 (8,646,878 death records, extract date: 25th June 2021). Deaths were stratified by 19 age groups (0, 1–4, 5–9, …, 80–84, 85+) and 6791 MSOAs. I did not use 129 death records (&lt;0.001%) for which sex was not recorded. In 48 (0.001%) age­-MSOA-­year combinations, the number of deaths exceeded population. Most of these were in people aged 85 years and older. In these cases, the population was set equal to the number of deaths.\n\n\n4.1.2 Statistical analysis\nI used a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain stable estimates of death rates by sharing information across age groups, MSOAs, and years. I conducted all analyses for women and men separately because mortality and trends differ by sex. In the model, the number of deaths in age group \\(a (=1,...,19)\\), MSOA \\(s (=1,...,6791)\\) and year \\(t (= 1,...,18)\\) follows a negative binomial distribution \\[\n\\text{deaths}_{ast} \\sim \\text{Negative Binomial}(p_{ast}, r).\n\\tag{4.1}\\] The parameter \\(p_{ast}\\) is \\[\np_{ast} = \\frac{r}{r + m_{ast} \\cdot \\text{Population}_{ast}}.\n\\tag{4.2}\\] where \\(r \\geq 0\\) is the overdispersion parameter, which accounts for extra variability not captured by other components in the model, and \\(m_{ast}\\) is the death rate. The negative binomial1 likelihood can be thought of as a generalisation of the Poisson likelihood, which allows for overdispersion, with larger values of \\(r\\) indicating more similarity to a Poisson distribution. A Poisson distribution is a suitable approximation for rare events, and I found that mortality at the MSOA-level was sufficiently rare such that death rates never came close to 1.\nLog-transformed death rates were modelled as a function of time, age group and MSOA. The model contains terms to capture the overall level and trend over time of mortality, as well as age-specific and MSOA-specific terms to allow deviations from these terms. Specifically, log-transformed death rates are modelled as \\[\n\\log({m_{ast}}) = \\alpha_0 + \\beta_0 t + \\alpha_{1s} + \\beta_{1s} t + \\alpha_{2a} + \\beta_{2a} t + \\xi_{as} + \\nu_{st} + \\gamma_{at},\n\\tag{4.3}\\] where \\(\\alpha_0\\) is the overall intercept across all age groups and MSOAs. \\(\\beta_0\\) quantifies the overall trend (over time) across all age groups and MSOAs. \\(\\alpha_{1s}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1s}\\) measure deviation from the overall intercept and trend terms, respectively, for each MSOA. \\(\\alpha_{2a}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2a}\\) measure deviation from the global level and trend, respectively, for each age group. I used first-order random walk priors on \\(\\alpha_{2a}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2a}\\) so that they vary smoothly over adjacent age groups, with the form \\(A_a \\sim \\mathcal{N}(A_{a-1}, \\sigma_A^2)\\) for both age-specific terms \\(\\alpha_{2a}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2a}\\). I constrained \\(\\alpha_{21} = 0\\) and \\(\\beta_{21} = 0\\) so each random walk was identifiable and centred on the corresponding overall term.\n\\(\\xi_{as}\\) is an age group-MSOA interaction term, which quantifies MSOA-specific deviations from the overall age group structure given by \\(\\alpha_{2a}\\). This allows different MSOAs to have different age-specific mortality patterns, and each age group’s death rate to have a different spatial pattern. This interaction term was modelled as \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_\\xi^2)\\).\n\\(\\nu_{st}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{at}\\) allow MSOA- and age group-specific non-linearity in the time trends. For each MSOA and age group, I again used first-order random walk priors with \\(\\nu_{s1} = \\gamma_{a1} = 0\\) so that the terms were identifiable.\nFor the main analysis, the MSOA intercepts and slopes, \\(\\alpha_{1s}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1s}\\), were modelled as nested hierarchical random effects, with MSOAs nested in districts, which were, in turn, nested in regions. The regional terms are centred on zero to allow the spatial effects to be identifiable.\nFor comparison, I also modelled the spatial effects using a BYM model, as in Equation 2.3. The CAR component of the model requires all spatial units to have neighbours. Thus, the MSOAs containing the Isle of Wight, Hayling Island, the Isles of Scilly and Canvey Island were each joined to the nearest mainland MSOA based on road or ferry connections.\nThe results of the spatial model were virtually identical to the hierarchical random effects model (correlation coefficient 0.999 for female and male sexes; mean difference 0.03 years for women and 0.009 years for men; mean absolute difference 0.07 years for women and 0.09 years for men for life expectancy estimates from the two approaches). I present results from the hierarchical model for two reasons. First, it allows neighbouring MSOAs that fall in different districts to differ more than those within the same district, reflecting the relevance of district as a unit of resource allocation and policy implementation. Second, the hierarchical model was computationally less demanding with run times about 1.4 times faster than the spatial model.\nAll standard deviation parameters of the random effects had \\(\\sigma \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0, 2)\\) priors. For the global intercept and slope, we used the diffuse prior \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2=10^5)\\). The overdispersion parameter \\(r\\) had the prior \\(\\mathcal{U}(0, 50)\\).\nTable B.1 shows all model parameters, their priors and dimensions.\nInference was performed using MCMC in NIMBLE package (de Valpine et al., 2022, 2017). I monitored convergence using trace plots and the R-hat diagnostic (Vehtari et al., 2021) and thinned post burn-in samples to reduce memory and storage use. For women, I ran four chains for 150,000 iterations, discarding the first 50,000 and thinning the remainder by 400 to obtain 1,000 post-burn-in draws from the posterior distribution of model parameters. For men, due to slower mixing, I ran eight chains for 150,000 iterations, discarding the first 100,000 and thinning the remainder by 400.\nIn 2017, the MSOA in Kensington and Chelsea, London where Grenfell Tower is located had 119 deaths, compared with 48 in 2016 and 51 in 2018. The additional deaths were caused by a fire in a high­rise residential building. This outlier year led to unstable estimates of the long­term trend in life expectancy in this MSOA, and also slightly changed estimates in other MSOAs in the district. To avoid this instability, when applying the statistical model, I replaced the number of deaths for this year with the mean of those in 2016 and 2018 for each age and sex group. When making estimates for 2017, the difference between actual and interpolated deaths was added back to the posterior estimates so that these deaths were counted in the corresponding year. The Grenfell Tower fire incident was, to the best of our knowledge, the only spatially-specific, long-tailed mortality event in England over the study period.\nI calculated life expectancy at birth, and probability of dying at specific ages by sex and MSOA using life table methods2.\nThe reported 95% credible intervals (CrIs) represent the 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles of the posterior distribution of estimated life expectancies. I also report the posterior probability that the estimated change over time in an MSOA represents an increase versus a decrease in life expectancy. Posterior probability represents the inherent uncertainty in life expectancy trends. In an MSOA in which the entire posterior distribution of life expectancy in 2019 is greater than in 2002, there is a 100% posterior probability of an increase, and hence around a 0% probability of a decrease, and vice versa. Posterior probabilities more distant from 50% indicate more certainty."

    "text": "4.2 Results\n\n4.2.1 Inequalities in life expectancy\nIn 2019, there was a 20.6 year (95% CrI 17.5–24.2) gap for women between the MSOA with the highest life expectancy (an MSOA in Camden, London; 95.4 years (92.4–98.7)) and the MSOA with the lowest life expectancy (an MSOA in Leeds; 74.7 years (73.4–76.2)). The gap was 27.0 years (23.4–31.1) for men, between an MSOA in Kensington and Chelsea, London (95.3 years (92.1–99.3)) and an MSOA in Blackpool (68.3 years (66.9–69.6)). The difference between the first and 99th percentiles of life expectancy in 2019 was 14.2 years (13.9–14.5) for women and 13.6 years (13.4–13.9) for men.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Ranked MSOA life expectancies in 2002 and 2019. Each point shows the posterior median life expectancy estimate for each MSOA, forming a curve; error bars are 95% credible intervals. Arrows indicate national life expectancies in England and selected comparator countries with life expectancies within the range of English MSOAs. Hong Kong had the highest global female and male life expectancies. In the EU, Bulgaria had the lowest and Spain had the highest life expectancies for women; Latvia had the lowest and Switzerland had the highest life expectancies for men. Life expectancy for England was calculated from the data used here, and for other countries from World Bank estimates in 2019 (World Bank, 2022).\n\n\nWhen all MSOAs were ranked on the basis of their life expectancy, the difference between successively ranked MSOAs was particularly large for the approximately 5% of MSOAs with the lowest and highest life expectancy (seen as the sharper decline or rise at the two ends of the ranked life expectancy curve in Figure 4.1), indicating distinct groups at extreme advantage and disadvantage.\nThe 124 (1.8%) of 6791 MSOAs with the lowest female life expectancy and 262 (3.9%) MSOAs with the lowest male life expectancy in 2019 were located in urban areas, particularly in the north, including Blackpool, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, and Newcastle. Many of the MSOAs with the highest life expectancy, especially for men, were in London and its neighbouring districts (Figure 4.2).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Map of life expectancy and the distribution of life expectancy in 2019. The areas in white have a life expectancy equal to the national life expectancy. 3 4\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Change in life expectancy\nFemale and male life expectancy were correlated across MSOAs with a correlation coefficient of 0.87 (Figure 4.3). Female life expectancy was higher than male life expectancy in all but 15 MSOAs. The female advantage was more than 5 years in 1498 (22.1%) of 6791 MSOAs and 1–5 years in another 5187 (76.4%). From 2002 to 2019, a decline in life expectancy was more probable than an increase in 124 mostly urban MSOAs of 6791 (1.8% of all MSOAs) for women, with posterior probabilities of greater than 80% in 34 of these. The largest estimated decline of 3.0 years (0.9–5.3; posterior probability of the estimated decline being a true decline 99.6%) occurred in an MSOA in Leeds (Figure 4.4, Figure 4.5).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Comparison of female and male life expectancy in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Geography of change in life expectancy from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Map of posterior probability that the estimated change represents a true increase or decrease in life expectancy from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nElsewhere, median posterior change was positive, ranging from less than 1 year in 408 MSOAs to more than 7 years in 63 MSOAs. Posterior probability of an increase in male life expectancy was more probable than a decrease in all but one MSOA in Blackpool, in which life expectancy changed by –0.4 years (–2.3 to 1.6; posterior probability of being a true decline 64%). For the other MSOAs, the increase ranged from less than 1 year in 31 MSOAs to more than 7 years in 114 MSOAs. The largest increases in female and male life expectancies were seen in some MSOAs in and around London (e.g., in the London Borough of Camden). In 5,133 (75.6%) MSOAs, male life expectancy increased more than female life expectancy (Figure 4.3), leading to a closing of the life expectancy gap between female and male sexes.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Distribution of MSOA life expectancies in each year from 2002 to 2019. Each point shows one MSOA. The central line shows national life expectancy.\n\n\nThe life expectancy increase from 2002 to 2019 was smaller in MSOAs where life expectancy had been lower in 2002, and vice versa, especially for women, which led to a larger life expectancy inequality across MSOAs in 2019 than in 2002 (Figure 4.6, Figure 4.7). Specifically, the aforementioned 20.6 year (17.5–24.2) gap for women and 27.0 year (23.4–31.1) gap for men between the lowest and highest MSOA life expectancies in 2019 were larger than those in 2002 by 4.3 years (–1.3 to 9.3) for women and 7.7 years (4.0 to 11.7) for men. Similarly, the gap between the first and 99th percentiles of MSOA life expectancy for women increased from 10.7 years (10.4–10.9) in 2002 to reach 14.2 years (13.9–14.5) in 2019, and for men increased from 11.5 years (11.3–11.7) in 2002 to 13.6 years (13.4–13.9) in 2019.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Maximum (highest) to minimum (lowest) and 99th to first percentile differences in life expectancy across 6791 MSOAs, 2002–19. The large difference in 2017 is due to the low life expectancy in the MSOA where the deaths in the Grenfell Tower (Kensington and Chelsea, London) fire took place.\n\n\nWhen broken down by time period, the vast majority of MSOAs saw a life expectancy increase in 2002–06 and 2006–10 (Figure 4.8). By contrast, women in 351 (5.2%) MSOAs had a median posterior change in life expectancy in 2010–14 that was negative. By 2014–19, the number of MSOAs with a negative median posterior change had risen to 1270 (18.7%) for women, with men in 784 (11.5%) MSOAs also showing a decline. These MSOAs tended to be places in which life expectancy was already low.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Change in MSOA life expectancy in different time periods, 2002–19. Each point shows the posterior median change in one MSOA. MSOAs are coloured by their life expectancy at the beginning of each period (e.g., for 2014–19, they are coloured by life expectancy in 2014).\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Life expectancy and deprivation\nLife expectancy at birth was inversely associated with the extent of unemployment, poverty, and low education in MSOA in 2002 and 2019 (Figure 4.9). There was substantial variation in life expectancy across MSOAs at any level of poverty or unemployment seen in the vertical spread of points in figure 6. From 2002 to 2019, there were, on average, smaller gains in life expectancy in the MSOAs with the highest levels of unemployment, poverty, and low education than in those in the lowest levels, especially for women.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: MSOA life expectancy in relation to measures of socioeconomic deprivation in the MSOA in 2002 and 2019. The socioeconomic measures are poverty, unemployment, and education. The lines show the smooth relationship fitted with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing for each year.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Inequalities in probability of survival\nSimilar to life expectancy, there were large inequalities in the probability of surviving from birth to 80 years, which ranged from 42% to 87% in women and 27% to 85% in men across MSOAs in 2019. These large survival inequalities were present at every stage of the life­course including childhood and early adolescence (0–14 years), young adulthood (15–29 years), working ages (30–69 years), and older ages (70–79 years) (Figure 4.10). Specifically, the probability of dying at different stages of the life­course in the 99th percentile of MSOAs was between 2.6 and 3.1 times that of the first percentile for female and male sexes in 2019. From 2002 to 2019, the relative inequality across MSOAs (ie, ratio of the 99th to the first percentile) in the probabilities of dying increased at every stage of the life course; the absolute inequality (ie, difference between the 99th and first percentiles) decreased slightly in all combinations except for working age women (30–69 years). Within childhood and adolescence, there were particularly large inequalities in infant mortality (0 to &lt;12 months), with a ratio of the 99th to the first percentile of MSOAs being 3.2 for female and male sexes in 2019. Infant mortality increased from 2014 to 2019 in 1378 (20.3%) MSOAs for girls and 888 (13.0%) for boys, many of which experienced a decline in life expectancy.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Probability of dying in specific ages in 6791 MSOAs in England in 2002 and 2019.

    "title": "4  Small: Life expectancy trends in England at the MSOA level",
    "section": "4.3 Discussion",
    "text": "4.3 Discussion\nThe high­-resolution analysis over space and time shows that life expectancy has not only ceased to increase, but has declined in many communities in England since 2010. The decline has accelerated since 2014, affecting the female population of 18.7% of MSOAs and the male population of 11.5% of MSOAs. In 1.8% of MSOAs, women have had a long­-term decline in life expectancy over two decades. MSOAs that have gained the least in longevity since 2002 were those that started with the lowest life expectancy, located in northern urban areas with high levels of poverty and unemployment, and with relatively low education. Conversely, those MSOAs with higher life expectancies in 2002 had some of the largest gains. As a result, England has seen widening inequalities in longevity, with the life expectancy gap surpassing 20 years for women and 27 years for men.\n\n4.3.1 Strengths and limitations\nThe main strength of the analysis is the presentation of high-­resolution data for mortality and longevity across England over a period of substantial change in economic, health, and social care policy. By applying a hierarchical model based on patterns of mortality over age, space, and time, I obtained robust yearly estimates of mortality and life expectancy, together with the uncertainty in these estimates, for small areas. By contrast, studies that had not used a coherent model produced unstable (i.e., very large uncertainty) or implausible life expectancy estimates in some MSOAs, despite having aggregated deaths over 5 years, nor could they analyse trends at the MSOA level (Office for National Statistics, 2015; Public Health England, 2021). Comparison of estimates at MSOA and district level shows that the estimated MSOA life expectancy range was about 1.8 times the district-­level range for women and 2.0 times the district-­level range for men in 2019.\nA limitation of the work in this chapter is that I did not break down age beyond 85 years, which might mask some differences in old­-age mortality and survival patterns. Although MSOAs have small populations and are designed to have some socioeconomic homogeneity, there are inevitable variations in socioeconomic status and health within them. To understand life expectancy inequalities in relation to individual socioeconomic characteristics requires linking health and other data such as census records, education, and taxes, as done in countries like New Zealand and Sweden.\nThe people who live in each MSOA can change due to both within­-country and international migration. Regression of the change in life expectancy from 2002 to 2019 in each MSOA against population turnover, the proportion of households in each MSOA in 2019 who were different from those who had lived there in 2002 (van Dijk et al., 2021), was not able to explain the variation in life expectancy change for women (\\(R^2 &lt; 0.001\\)) or for men (\\(R^2 = 0.01\\)) at the national level. Studies in both the UK (Connolly et al., 2007) and USA (Ezzati et al., 2008) have also shown that migration is not sufficient to explain the trends in health and health inequalities, and that these trends are largely due to real changes in population health. Even if rising inequalities are partly due to health-­selective migration, this phenomenon has social and economic origins that should be addressed through employment opportunities, affordable housing, high-­quality education, and health care.\nPopulation and mortality statistics in the UK are generated independently from one another. As a result, we encountered a situation of having more deaths than population in a small percentage (0.001%) of age-­MSOA­-year combinations, a phenomenon that was more common in those aged 85 years and older. This finding might be due to errors in population estimates in years between censuses or because some people (e.g., those living in long­term care facilities such as care homes), are counted in one MSOA for the population statistic but have their death registered in another. Furthermore, care home residents might have relocated from other MSOAs, with different socioeconomic characteristics from that in which the care home is located. This factor could attenuate the association between socioeconomic variables and life expectancy. The extent of this underestimation is modest; however, because a large part of life expectancy variation is due to deaths at earlier ages, when people are less likely to live and die in care homes (Bennett et al., 2018).\n\n\n4.3.2 Comparison with previous literature\nThe life expectancy estimates in specific years are similar to the snapshots presented by the ONS and Public Health England (Office for National Statistics, 2015; Public Health England, 2021), with correlation coefficients of 0.92-0.95 and mean differences of –0.004 to 0.19 years. However, these reports could not analyse trends because data were aggregated over 5 years (2009–13, 2013–17, or 2015–19). In terms of trends, studies that grouped small ­area units into deciles of deprivation have detected a decline in female life expectancy in the one or two most deprived deciles (Bennett et al., 2018; Marmot et al., 2020). By analysing trends at the MSOA level, I could identify the communities in which longevity is declining and show that the decline, which began around 2010 in women in some MSOAs, has spread and accelerated since 2014.\nCongdon (2019) also used spatial models to smooth over MSOA-level data of mortality, but specifically drug-related deaths and suicides between 2012-16. The author singled out the district of Blackpool as containing many of the MSOAs with the most extreme relative risks of death from these causes, including the MSOA I found had the lowest life expectancy for men in 2019.\n\n\n4.3.3 Is England the new USA (in a bad way)?\nOver the period of this analysis, from 2002 to 2019, national life expectancy increased in high-­income countries in Australasia, Europe, and North America. Female life expectancy has stagnated or declined in various intervals since 2010 in the UK (84% of the UK population in 2019 lived in England) and in some other high-­income countries including France, Germany, Italy, and the USA; the UK and USA have had some of the poorest performances in terms of the duration or extent of slowdown or reversal in longevity gain. The comparative performance of high-­income countries’ longevity trends has been attributed to differences in risk factors such as smoking, health care, and social inequalities (Leon et al., 2019).\nTo our knowledge, nationwide trend data for small-­area life expectancy are available only in the USA. The declining life expectancy in numerous English MSOAs since 2014, especially those that already had a low life expectancy, resembles a trend spanning nearly three decades in the USA in two ways (Chetty et al., 2016; Dwyer-Lindgren et al., 2017; Ezzati et al., 2008). First, in both countries, there is substantial variation in life expectancy at any level of poverty, which might be due to geographical variations in health behaviours, the public health programmes that influence these behaviours or otherwise prevent disease, and health services (Burn-Murdoch, 2023; Chetty et al., 2016). The second similarity in small­ area life expectancy trends is that the decline in life expectancy was more widespread in women than in men (Ezzati et al., 2008). Historically, women and men had similar life expectancies in high-­income nations before a rise in traffic injuries and diseases associated with specific occupations and health behaviours such as smoking and alcohol use created a male mortality disadvantage in the 20th century (Beltrán-Sánchez et al., 2015). The closing of female and male life expectancy in the late 20th century and early 21st century in many high-­income nations (Kontis et al., 2017) is partly due to the dynamics of smoking, which peaked later in women than in men, and affects causes of death such as respiratory diseases and lung cancer that have stagnated or even increased in women in deprived communities (Bennett et al., 2018; Leon et al., 2019). However, it is rare for the convergence of female and male life expectancies to occur in the form of female life expectancy decline (Ezzati et al., 2008), which might be due to a combination of the worsening economic, psychosocial (e.g., poverty, stress, and domestic violence), and behavioural (smoking and alcohol use) determinants of mortality in English women.\nIn both countries, the decline in life expectancy was associated with the economic trends of unemployment and insecure and low-­wage employment following late 20th century deindustrialisation. In England, these economic trends led to a larger loss of jobs in the north than in London and the southeast (Blundell et al., 2020; Davenport and Zarenko, 2020). These long-­term changes were followed by a reduction in social support and welfare payments and in funding to the local governments during the austerity period, which increased poverty, including in-­work poverty (Alexiou et al., 2021; Blundell et al., 2020), and also had larger effects in the north than in London and southern parts of the country and worsened the effects of loss of secure employment (Alexiou et al., 2021; Davenport and Zarenko, 2020; Gray and Barford, 2018). Poverty and reduced funding to services increase mortality through health behaviours such as smoking and alcohol use, poor nutrition and living environment, psychosocial pathways, and lower provision or use of preventive and curative health care.\n\n\n4.3.4 Summary\nI performed a high-resolution spatiotemporal analysis of all deaths in England from 2002 to 2019, using a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain estimates of age-specific death rates by age, sex, and MSOA. I used life table methods to calculate life expectancy at birth and probabilities of death in different ages by sex and MSOA.\nIn 2002–06 and 2006–10, all but a few (0–1%) MSOAs had a life expectancy increase for women and men. In 2010–14, female life expectancy decreased in 351 (5.2%) of 6791 MSOAs. And by 2014–19, the number of MSOAs with declining life expectancy was 1270 (18.7%) for women and 784 (11.5%) for men. The life expectancy increase from 2002 to 2019 was smaller in MSOAs where life expectancy had been lower in 2002 (mostly northern urban MSOAs), and larger in MSOAs where life expectancy had been higher in 2002 (mostly MSOAs in and around London).\nThese results show that numerous communities in England had begun to have a decline in longevity, mirroring an earlier trend in the USA. That these trends happened in the decade before the Covid-19 pandemic – so-called “normal times” – is worrying, and signals ongoing policy failures to tackle the social determinants of health.\n\n\n\n\nAlexiou A, Fahy K, Mason K, Bennett D, Brown H, Bambra C, Taylor-Robinson D, Barr B. 2021.

    "title": "5  Smaller: Life expectancy inequality in London at the LSOA level",
    "section": "5.1 Methods",
    "text": "5.1 Methods\n\n5.1.1 Mortality and population data\nI performed a high-­resolution spatiotemporal analysis of civil registration data in which I extracted de­-identified data for all deaths in London from 2002 to 2019 (909,097 death records, extract date: 25th June 2021). Deaths were stratified by 19 age groups (0, 1–4, 5–9, …, 80–84, 85+) and 4835 LSOAs. These LSOAs fit inside 33 districts: London’s 32 boroughs and the City of London. I did not use 16 death records (0.002%) for which sex was not recorded. In 3267 (0.099%) age­-LSOA-­year combinations, the number of deaths exceeded the population. In 88% of these combinations, the deaths exceeded population by only one or two, and 96% of these combinations were in people aged 80 years and older. In these cases, the population was set equal to the number of deaths.\n\n\n5.1.2 House price estimates\nWe scraped data from real estate website Rightmove for all London postcodes, obtaining 2.1 million sales records for years 2002–2019. We used postcode to map homes to 24,131 (96.4% of 25,031) OAs in London which belonged to 4830 LSOAs (&gt;99% of 4835). The 900 (3.6%) OAs with no sales over this period tended to be places with higher proportions of rented housing, especially rented social housing.\nWe then used a mixed-effects model to estimate the house price at OA level. The model was formulated to take into account how prices vary in relation to location, time and characteristics of the property. Specifically, the model included effects for the following: OA and district of the house, quarter of year in which the transaction took place, type of house (flat, terraced, semi-detached, detached house), status of land ownership (freehold (owns the property and the land upon which the property is built), leasehold (owns the property but not the land, which is leased)), whether the property is an existing property or newly constructed, and number of bedrooms, as well as interactions between the effects. Further details can be found in the paper (Bennett et al., 2023). We used the median of all constituent OAs for each LSOA’s price. We presented the price estimates for a two-bedroom, leasehold, existing (not newly constructed) flat sold in the spring season. Two-bedroom leasehold flats were the most common type of sale during the study period with 19.7% of sales.\n\n\n5.1.3 Statistical analysis\nThe model was largely the same as Chapter 4, with a few changes: First, the negative binomial likelihood from Equation 4.1 was replaced with a beta-binomial likelihood, \\[\n\\text{deaths}_{ast} \\sim \\text{Beta-Binomial}(m_{ast} \\rho, (1 - m_{ast}) \\rho, \\text{Population}_{ast}).\n\\tag{5.1}\\] where \\(m_{ast}\\) is the death rate and \\(\\rho \\geq 0\\) is the overdispersion parameter. I found that the variability of the LSOA-level mortality data was such that death rates did near 1, violating the assumption for Equation 4.1 that deaths are rare events. In fact, when I tested a negative binomial or Poisson likelihood, I found the death rates for some age-LSOA-year combinations exceeded 1, which of course is impossible in the real world. The beta-binomial likelihood is a generalisation of the binomial distribution that allows for overdispersion. The death rates were logit-transformed and the model structure is otherwise the same as Equation 4.3, but using nested hierarchical random effects with LSOAs nested in MSOAs, which were nested in districts. A \\(\\rho \\sim \\exp (0.1)\\) hyperprior was used for the overdispersion term, and \\(\\sigma \\sim \\mathcal{N}^+(1)\\) hyperpriors for the standard deviation parameters, as recommended by the Stan development team (Stan development team, 2020).\nTable B.2 shows all model parameters, their priors and dimensions.\nAgain, I used NIMBLE for MCMC (de Valpine et al., 2022, 2017), with four chains of 80,000 iterations, discarding the first 30,000, thinning the remainder by 200 and checking for convergence using trace plots and R-hat (Vehtari et al., 2021).\nThe local effect of the Grenfell Tower fire was even more pronounced at the LSOA level. In 2017, the LSOA in Kensington and Chelsea where Grenfell Tower is located had 75 deaths, compared to less than 15 in 2016 and 2018. The additional deaths were caused by a fire in a high­rise residential building. I used the same treatment as in Chapter 4 to remove the outlier from the modelling stage and add the excess mortality in at a later stage before calculating life expectancies. I defined life expectancy inequality as the difference between 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of LSOA life expectancies."

    "text": "5.2 Results\n\n5.2.1 Inequalities in life expectancy\nLife expectancy at birth for London increased from 80.9 (95% CrI 80.8–81.0) years in 2002 to 85.4 (85.3–85.5) years in 2019 for women, and from 76.1 (76.0–76.2) years to 81.6 (81.5–81.7) years for men. Life expectancy inequality (difference between 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) was 19.1 (18.4–19.7) years for women and 17.2 (16.7–17.8) years for men, in 2019 which is a substantial increase from 11.1 (10.7–11.5) years for women and 11.6 (11.3–12.0) years for men in 2002. The corresponding estimates for life expectancy inequality in 2019 calculated using MSOA level analysis in Chapter 4 were 10.8 (10.3–11.3) years for women and 11.0 (10.5–11.6) years for men.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Map of life expectancy and the distribution of life expectancy in London in 2019. The areas in white have a life expectancy equal to the overall London life expectancy.\n\n\nLife expectancy in 2019 was highest in LSOAs in central London districts of Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, City of London and Camden, in the southwest (Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames) and parts of the northwest (e.g., parts of Harrow and Barnet), with life expectancy in many LSOAs surpassing 90 years (Figure 5.1). Low life expectancy was spread in LSOAs throughout the city but was more common in outer east and southeast London.\n\n\n5.2.2 Change in life expectancy and inequality\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Geography of change in life expectancy in London from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nThere was large variation across London in how much life expectancy increased from 2002 to 2019, ranging from &lt;2 years in 537 (11.1%) LSOAs for women and 214 (4.4%) for men to &gt;10 years in 220 (4.6%) for women and 211 (4.4%) for men (Figure 5.2). In 134 (2.8%) LSOAs for women and 32 (0.7%) for men, life expectancy may have declined, with a posterior probability of a decline greater than 80% in 41 (0.8%) and 14 (0.3%) LSOAs for women and men, respectively. Life expectancy increased more in LSOAs in central and inner east and south London than in outer areas.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Change in LSOA life expectancy in different time periods, 2002–19. Each point shows the posterior median change in one LSOA. LSOAs are coloured by their life expectancy at the beginning of each period.\n\n\nThe rate of increase in life expectancy was smaller after 2010 compared to the earlier years for both sexes (Figure 5.3), and the number of LSOAs in which life expectancy may have fallen was larger, especially from 2010 to 2014. The slow-down or reversal of LSOA life expectancy after 2010 is consistent with the pattern seen throughout England’s MSOAs in Chapter 4, which may be partly due to increase in poverty due to low-wage employment and cuts in services in the austerity era. However, the progressive worsening of life expectancy gain and loss from 2010–2014 to 2014–2019 which was seen in other parts of England did not happen in London (Figure 5.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Life expectancy at birth and inequality in life expectancy within London’s 33 local authority districts from 2002 to 2019. Each panel plots life expectancy against life expectancy inequality over time for all 33 districts, and highlights the trend line for the district which is named at the top of the panel. The districts are arranged according to their approximate location in Greater London. The large decline in life expectancy in Kensington and Chelsea in 2017 is due to the deaths caused by the fire in Grenfell Tower.\n\n\nThere was substantial variation in the size of life expectancy increase over short distances. As a result of this spatial heterogeneity, life expectancy inequality increased not only in London as a whole, but also in every district in London alongside increasing average life expectancy (Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Distribution of estimates of Lower-layer Super Output Area (LSOA) life expectancy at birth for 2002 and 2019, and of the change from 2002 to 2019 in 33 London districts.

    "title": "5  Smaller: Life expectancy inequality in London at the LSOA level",
    "section": "5.3 Discussion",
    "text": "5.3 Discussion\nThis high-resolution analysis revealed that in London, a major global metropolis, not only has life expectancy inequality increased substantially, but this increase has happened both between districts and within every district.\nLife expectancy in London has previously only been reported at MSOA level, as discussed in Chapter 4. When aggregated to MSOA level, the LSOA life expectancies in this work were correlated with MSOA estimates in Chapter 4 (correlation coefficient \\(&gt;0.99\\) and mean difference \\(\\leq 0.01\\) years for both sexes).\nIn the main paper (Bennett et al., 2023), we also looked at how life expectancy improvements varied with house prices and their changes throughout the city, and whether population change may partly mediate this association. We found the change in life expectancy had different associations with price change in more expensive versus lower cost communities: where prices were high at the turn of the century, life expectancy increased substantially independently of price change, and with little change in the resident population. In contrast, in areas that started with lower prices, life expectancy only increased proportional to price change, and was accompanied by a greater influx of new residents into the local area. This change in residents saw a greater proportion of the population in working ages, and socioeconomically better off, and an outflux of residents in retirement ages and to a lesser extent children, adolescents and young adults. This implies that a portion of the change in life expectancy may be due to change in the resident population.\n\n5.3.1 Strengths and limitations\nThe main strength of the study is the presentation of very high-resolution data on life expectancy and house prices in consistent spatial and temporal units in a major global city over a period of substantial policy interest and investment in urban renewal. Carrying out the study at the LSOA level uncovered inequalities to a fuller extent.\nI defined life expectancy inequality as the difference between 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of LSOA life expectancies rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum as in Chapter 4. This was because the LSOAs with extremely low life expectancies tended to contain age­-LSOA-­year combinations in which the number of deaths exceeded the population. Small-area population, which is the denominator of age-specific death rates, is estimated by the ONS for intercensal years, and may be subject to error. This is especially the case in older ages when some people live and die in a long-term care facility, and may be counted towards population (denominator of death rates) in their original LSOA of residence and towards deaths (numerator of death rates) in the LSOA where the care facility is located. There were a higher proportion (0.099% compared to 0.001% in Chapter 4) of spatial units with this issue at the LSOA level. In 2019, 11 LSOAs for women and one LSOA for men had life expectancies in which the median estimate was greater than 100 years. Given the MSOAs with the highest life expectancies for each sex in Chapter 4 were both in London and exceeded 95 years, these estimates may be plausible for some LSOAs, which contain around a fifth of the population of MSOAs. However, upon inspection, four out of the five LSOAs with the largest increases in life expectancy, which were also LSOAs with life expectancies above 100, were adjacent to LSOAs with very large decreases. And in four out of five LSOAs with the largest estimated decreases in life expectancy, estimated population counts were lower than the recorded death counts in the older age groups in several years of the data, implying that populations or deaths may have been allocated incorrectly. Subsequent inspection showed that postcodes coinciding with, or adjacent to, LSOAs with the largest increases and decreases contained care homes, which can lead to the place of residence or death being inconsistently recorded for some of their residents.\nMortality and house prices were estimated using two separate models because a joint model would be extremely complex and would require additional assumptions about how house prices are associated with age- and LSOA-specific mortality. It was only possible to indirectly evaluate, through LSOA-level population turnover and population characteristics, whether population change is a potential mechanism for the observed change in life expectancy because routine death registration in England only records place of residence at the time of death. Further, there are currently limited time-series data on quality of housing, access to jobs, services and amenities, and other home and neighbourhood characteristics that affect health. To understand whether changes in the life expectancy of communities arises from changes in the health of the population, itself due to changes in their economic status and/or local environment and amenities, versus a change in the resident population requires linked datasets which are able to track over time environmental characteristics of areas together with individuals’ place of residence, socioeconomic status and mortality records.\n\n\n5.3.2 Comparison with previous literature\nThe inequalities of 19.1 (18.4–19.7) years for women in 2019 and 17.2 (16.7–17.8) years for men in London in 2019 are some of the largest for any city in the literature and the largest for women. Further, some of the inequality in the tails of the life expectancy distribution is masked by our choice of inequality measure, the 2.5th-97.5th percentile difference, rather than the full range across all LSOAs.\nIn a study of the 397 census tracts in King County, Washington, a county ranking in the top 5% of the US in terms of both income and life expectancy, Dwyer-Lindgren et al. (2017) found an 18.3 year gap in life expectancy for men between the top and bottom tracts in 2014, and a 14.8 gap for women. For Vancouver, Canada, Yu et al. (2021) found a difference in 2016 of 9.5 years for men and 8.3 years for women between the 90th and and 10th percentiles of 368 census tracts. Using the same measure of inequality as the Vancouver study, Jonker et al. (2012) uncovered a 8.2 year and 9.2 year gap in life expectancy for women and men for 89 small areas in Rotterdam. Across six large cities in Latin America, Bilal et al. (2019) observed the largest difference between the top and bottom decile of life expectancy at birth was 17.7 years for women in Santiago, Chile.\nTo some extent, as this is one of the highest-resolution studies in the literature, it is natural that we would find large inequalities. As we go to finer and finer resolutions, we will always uncover more inequality, until we reach the physical limit of the individual and the inequality is between the earliest neonatal death and the oldest person to die in the city.\nIn terms of work specific to London, beyond that at the MSOA level in Chapter 4, Congdon (2014) considered both ill-health and mortality for 625 wards in London, finding more than a two-fold variation in the percent of life spent in disability for men, but did not mention the absolute inequality of life expectancy in the city. Some studies have documented changes in spatial patterns of poverty in London,(Bosetti, 2015; Travers et al., 2016) and have found that poverty rates have fallen in inner East London but may have risen in some outer London areas, with corresponding changes in the share of the population working in higher professional occupations. No previous study has reported how life expectancy change in small-area units coincided with change in house prices.\n\n\n5.3.3 Urban policy and public health implications\nSince the turn of the millennium, London’s population and economy have grown substantially. The economic growth has been highly polarised with high-pay and high-skilled employment alongside low-pay and insecure jobs (Overman and Xu, 2022). As a result, despite city-wide growth in income, nearly one half of London’s population fall in the bottom two quintiles of national income deprivation (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019). Together with an uncontrolled property market, this has created house prices that are unfavourable to low-income families, displacing entire subgroups of the population to cheaper parts of the city, with fewer amenities and worse access to jobs, quality education, healthcare and other services and amenities (Bosetti, 2015). Many are unable to purchase (versus rent) and hence spend an increasing share of income on housing, and/or live in lower quality or smaller accommodation in the more desirable districts (Bosetti, 2015; Travers et al., 2016). These trends may have contributed to health inequalities both between nearby areas and across the entire city alongside other trends such as differences in the extent of neighbourhood improvement or provisions of health and social care services as council budgets were reduced as a result of austerity policies.\nThe evolution of London, and major cities in other high-income nations and emerging economies, into places where only the well-off can afford to own properties, where the balance of the city is driven by the cost of property and wealth dominates access, poses a gloomy, non-cohesive future for these cities."

    "section": "6.1 Methods",
    "text": "6.1 Methods\nI performed a high-­resolution spatiotemporal analysis of civil registration data in which I extracted de­-identified data for all deaths in England from 2002 to 2019 (8,648,191 death records, extract date: 17th November 2022). England was divided into 314 districts according to the boundaries in 2020. Deaths were assigned into the following age groups: 0, 1–4, 5–9, …, 80–84, 85+ years. I did not use 130 death records (&lt;0.001%) for which sex was not recorded. There were no age­-district-year combinations in which the number of deaths from all causes exceeded the population.\nEach death record in the post-neonatal period was assigned an ICD-10 code corresponding to the underlying cause of death. For neonates, which are not assigned an underlying cause of death, I used the ICD-10 code in the first position on the death record. I used ICD-10 codes to assign each death to 136 cause groups of the WHO Global Health Estimates (GHE) study (World Health Organization, 2020); these groups encompass causes of death with related aetiology and clinical and public health relevance. I also grouped diabetes mellitus and nephritis and nephrosis (hereafter referred to as diabetes) as these deaths might have a similar history. I used the top 12 causes of death according to the total number of deaths from 2002 to 2019 for cause-specific analysis, as well as a residual groups comprising deaths from all other cancers, all other NCD, all other CVD, all other infections, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (IMPN), and injuries (external causes). Together, these form a mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive list of causes of death (Figure 6.1).\nThe full list of ICD-10 codes for each cause group can be found in Table D.1.\nAlthough the size of the spatial unit of analysis has been increased to the district-level, by stratifying by cause of death, the number of deaths in each age-district-year-cause stratum is still very small. As in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, I used a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain stable estimates of death rates. I conducted all analyses separately by sex and cause group.\nI used a binomial likelihood: \\[\n\\text{deaths}_{ast} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(m_{ast}, \\text{Population}_{ast}).\n\\tag{6.1}\\] A beta-binomial was trialled but did not improve model fit. The model is as follows: \\[\n\\text{logit}({m_{ast}}) = \\alpha_0 + \\beta_0 t + \\alpha_{1s} + \\beta_{1s} t + \\alpha_{2a} + \\beta_{2a} t + \\xi_{as} + \\gamma_{at},\n\\tag{6.2}\\] where the terms have the same meanings as Equation 4.3. This is the same as model Chapter 5, but without a random walk for each spatial unit, which was tested but did not improve the fit despite adding a lot of complexity.\nSpatial effects were modelled using a ICAR effect rather than the nested hierarchy of random effects seen in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5. The geographies here only allow a two-tier hierarchy with nine regions mapping to 314 districts, which was less preferable than a spatial model. The ICAR model requires all spatial units to have neighbours. Thus, the districts containing the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly were each joined to the nearest mainland district based on road or ferry connections.\nAll model parameters, their priors and dimensions are in Table B.3.\nI fitted the model in the probabilistic programming language NumPyro (Phan et al., 2019) and obtained 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of model parameters that were used to calculate age-specific death rates. Where possible, non-centred parametrisations were used in the model to improve the efficiency of the NUTS samplers. I ran four chains with a warmup of 2000 iterations and then 10,000 further iterations and thinned the remainder by 40 to obtain 1000 post-burn-in draws from the posterior distribution.\nI ran a model for a combined group of all deaths to calculate life expectancy in each district. Death rates for this total mortality group, and for injuries, were corrected in 2017 in Kensington and Chelsea for the Grenfell fire by imputing using the mean deaths from injuries between 2016 and 2018 before running the model.\nThe primary reporting outcome is the unconditional probability of dying between birth and 80 years of age. Unconditional probability is the probability of death in the absence of competing causes of death, and is calculated using life table methods from age-specific death rates from the cause of interest. I limited the age range to 80 years because the probability of death in the absence of competing causes equals 100% when the entire life course is considered. The reported 95% credible intervals represent the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the posterior distribution of estimated probability of death.\nI calculated the contributions of deaths from each cause of death, in each age group, to the life expectancy change for each district between different time periods using Arriaga’s method, which is widely used to decompose life expectancy differences between populations or population subgroups (Arriaga, 1984). Arriaga’s method calculates how much each age group contributes to the life expectancy difference by quantifying how much death rate differences at that age change the years of life lived both at that age and in subsequent ages through changing the number of survivors. It then partitions the age-specific contributions to the life expectancy gap by cause of death in proportion to the difference in cause-specific death rates between the subgroups. The cause-specific death rates were scaled such that the sum over all causes was equal to the estimate for total mortality. For this analysis, I used the sample mean death rate in each age-district-year-cause combination.\nDetails on the calculations for both the probability of dying and Arriaga’s method can be found in Appendix A."

Figure 6.1 shows the leading causes of death for each sex.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Total number of deaths for the 12 leading causes of death in England from 2002 to 2019, and the residual groups all other cancers, all other NCD, all other CVD, all other infections, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (IMPN), and injuries. The boxes are coloured by the wider groups of CVDs; NCDs; cancers; maternal, perinatal, nutritional and infectious causes; injuries. See Table D.1 for ICD-10 codes for each category. 1\n\n\nIn the following sections, I will discuss, in turn, each of the wider cause groups (CVDs; NCDs; cancers; maternal, perinatal, nutritional and infectious causes; injuries) in order of the largest proportion of total deaths.\n\n\n6.2.2 Cardiovascular diseases\nAlthough mortality from CVD has more than halved since the 1980s in England, it remained the wider cause group with the largest proportion of deaths at 2,712,895 (31.4%). The highest probability of dying in 2019 for any sex-cause-district combination was for ischaemic heart disease for men in Manchester at 0.13 (0.12-0.13) (Figure 6.2).\nAsaria et al. (2012) found CVD mortality followed a persistent downward trend in nearly all wards in England from 1982 to 2006. Both ischaemic heart disease (Figure 6.2) and stroke mortality (Figure 6.3) have continued to follow this trend through to 2019 at the district level. These reflect improvements in reducing and controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, organisational changes to the NHS such that acute CVD episodes are treated in specific centres, improvements in the treatment of CVD including coronary angiographies and stent insertion, and public health campaigns such as FAST (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, Time) so the general public know when to seek emergency help for a stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Probability of dying from ischaemic heart disease between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Probability of dying from a stroke between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Probability of dying from all other CVDs between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nAll other CVD also showed a downward trend, with the exceptions of Hastings and, more noticeably, the Isle of Wight. Looking at the raw data for these districts, there is a step increase the use of ICD-10 code I51.5 – a garbage CVD code (Murray and Lopez, 1996) – since around 2012, suggesting these trends result from poor coding practice.\n\n\n6.2.3 Non-communicable diseases\nNon-communicable diseases (excluding CVD and cancers) were responsible for 2,508,844 (29.0%) deaths from 2002 to 2019 (Figure 6.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Probability of dying from Alzheimer’s and other dementias between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nAlzheimer’s and other dementias saw the largest increases of any cause, with all districts observing an increase for both sexes (Figure 6.5). It was also one of the most unequal causes of death, with 4.1- and 3.6-fold differences for women and men between the highest and lowest districts in 2019. This reflects that, beyond age and family history, the main risk factors for Alzheimer’s and other dementias are the same as for CVD (smoking, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol).\nSome part of this trend may be due to increased diagnosis and coding of deaths as dementias, with doctors increasingly assigning mental and neurological conditions as the underlying cause of death rather than simply “dying of old age”. It is worth noting that given only 96,109 (14.5% of 663,692) of deaths from Alzheimer’s and other dementias occur in those under 80 years, the probability of dying between birth and 80 is probably not the best metric for summarising this particular disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Probability of dying from COPD between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had the largest geographical variation of any disease for women, with a 6.0-fold variation (4.4-fold for men). The probability of dying declined in a larger proportion of districts for men (305 (97.1%)) than for women (215 (68.5%)). This is a result of the main risk factor, tobacco smoking, peaking later in women than in men. The largest increases for both sexes were seen in Kingston upon Hull for (45.9% (24.8% to 67.9%) for women and 20.6% (2.9% to 40.7%) for men).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Probability of dying from diabetes mellitus, nephritis and nephrosis between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nMortality from diabetes decreased in every district for both sexes (Figure 6.7), matching trends at the national level in the literature (Pearson-Stuttard et al., 2021). Those who are African-Caribbean, Black African, Chinese or South Asian are more at risk, and the highest probabilities of dying for each sex were in east London – one of the most ethnically diverse areas in the country. Specifically, the borough of Newham had the highest mortality for both sexes (0.01 (0.01-0.01) for women and 0.02 (0.01-0.02) for men).\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Probability of dying for men from liver cirrhosis between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nLiver cirrhosis, an advanced stage of liver damage, was only of the top 12 leading causes of death for men (67,116 (1.6%)) but not for women. It has perhaps the most interesting geography for change of all causes, with contrast between huge decreases in London and increases in the rest of the country, with the largest in the coastal southwest and east. The geography is perhaps indicative of the contrasting dynamics of the two main risk factors for liver cirrhosis: alcohol misuse and hepatitis B/C infection. Alcohol is the main cause of liver disease, and has driven a large proportion of increases in liver cirrhosis throughout Europe (Blachier et al., 2013). Alcohol is generally consumed less in the capital, with London having the lowest percentage of adults who abstain from drinking alcohol (23.6%) and the lowest percentage of adults who drink over 14 units per week (20.1%) (Public Health England, 2021). On the other hand, the prevalence of hepatitis B/C has decreased over the past decades. There has been reduced incidence and vaccination for hepatitis B. Although a large number of people acquired hepatitis C in the 1970s and 1980s, the virus has since been identified and transmission has reduced (Blachier et al., 2013).\nAll other NCDs had the highest mortality for any disease for women, with the highest probability of dying of 0.09 (0.08-0.09) in Blackpool (Figure 6.9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Probability of dying from all other NCDs between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Cancers\nCancers accounted for 28.5% of all deaths, nearly the same total mortality burden as NCDs. With over 150 different types of cancer, each with their own anatomical and molecular subtypes, cancer is extremely complex, with a specialist workforce dedicated to each unique cancer. Compared with CVDs and NCDs, which are dominated by their major causes (ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and Alzheimer’s, COPD and diabetes, respectively), cancers have the largest number of individual causes in the top 12. I felt I should go deeper into the cancer story, and pay further attention to a wider variety of site-specific cancers. This is the focus of Chapter 7.\n\n\n6.2.5 Maternal, perinatal, nutritional and infectious causes\nAs is the case in most high income countries, which are in the third stage of the epidemiologic transition, there are far fewer deaths (666,783 (7.7%)) from maternal, perinatal, nutritional and infectious causes compared to the NCDs of group 2 (including CVD and cancers). Although notably, these results consider the period before the Covid-19 pandemic, so the cause-composition will have changed to include more deaths from infections over the most recent years.\nMortality from lower respiratory infections, which include influenza and pneumonia, can vary greatly between years depending on the severity of the virus and whether the flu vaccination prevents the prevalent strain. It also depends on the strength of the immune system of the infected. The ability of the lungs to recover from infection can be degraded by years of industrial exposure or smoking, which perhaps influences the high mortality in the urban northwest (Figure 6.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Probability of dying from lower respiratory infections between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\nThe similar profiles for men and women for the level of mortality from all other IMPN in 2019 (Figure 6.11) reflects that the three main causes by number of deaths are other infectious diseases, diarrhoeal diseases, low birth weight rather than maternal conditions. However, the change in probability of dying was greatly different between the sexes, with 71 (22.6%) districts seeing an increase for women, the largest in Barrow-in-Furness (55.6% (-0.8% to 135.2%)), compared to only 5 (0.02%) districts for men. Without further disaggregating this group, it is difficult to suggest drivers of these trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Probability of dying from all other infections, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Injuries\nAccounting for only 295,034 (3.4%) of total deaths from 2002 to 2019, injuries contribute the smallest proportion of the wider groups of causes of death. The highest mortality in 2019 were in coastal areas, where there are obvious natural hazards, are in the urban northwest (Figure 6.12). Blackpool had the highest probability of dying for men at 0.04 (0.04-0.05), which corresponds with the literature on rates of mortality from drugs and suicide (Congdon, 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: Probability of dying from injuries between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.7 Contribution to life expectancy inequality\nThe district with the highest life expectancy for both sexes in 2019 was the City of London, a small and affluent district in the capital, at 90.1 years for women and 87.4 years2 for men. For women, the district with the lowest life expectancy was Manchester, which was 10.1 years lower than the best-performing district. Blackpool had the lowest life expectancy for men, 13.0 years less than the City of London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: Contributions of deaths from specific causes to life expectancy inequality in 2019 between the district with the highest life expectancy (City of London for both sexes) and all other local authority districts in England. The side panel shows the difference in life expectancy compared to the best-performing district, by summing over the causes. The top panel shows the contribution for each district for each cause.\n\n\nThe major contributing cause to inequality with respect to the best-performing district was Alzheimer’s and other dementias for women, which was the leading contributor for 254 (80.9%) districts. For men, all other NCD was the leading cause in 220 (70.0%) districts. From the groups of cancers, trachea, bronchus and lung cancers and all other cancers presented clear gradients, with the largest contributions in the worst-performing districts (Figure 6.13). Specifically, lung cancer had a difference in contribution between the 10th and 90th percentile districts of 0.6 years for women and 0.5 years for men, and all other cancers was 0.5 years for both sexes. There were strong gradients from the best- to worst-performing districts for all other NCD (10th-90th percentile differences of 0.9 years for women and 0.8 years for men), ischaemic heart disease (0.5 years and 0.8 years), and COPD (0.6 years and 0.5 years). Contributions to inequality from Alzheimer’s and other dementias were not as obviously directional, but the cause group had large 10th-90th percentile differences of 0.8 years for women and 0.5 years for men. There was a more prominent gradient for injuries in men (0.5 years) than women (0.3 years).\n\n\n6.2.8 Contribution to life expectancy change\nFrom 2002 to 2019, every district increased in life expectancy for both women and men (Figure 6.14). This was driven largely by decreases in ischaemic heart disease, which contributed gains of between 0.7 and 1.9 years for women between 1.4 and 4.0 years for men. In contrast, Alzheimer’s and other dementias acted in the other direction, forcing life expectancy downwards by between 0.2 and 1.1 years for women and between 0.4 and 1.0 years for women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Men\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14: Contributions of deaths from specific causes to life expectancy difference between the district population in 2002 and the population in 2019 in 314 local authority districts in England. The side panel shows the change in life expectancy over that time, by summing over the causes. The top panel shows the contribution for each district for each cause.\n\n\nIn Figure 6.15, I break the overall trend down into two time periods around the year 2010. This both follows the analysis for Figure 4.8, but it is also the year there was a change in government, and a move in fiscal policy towards austerity.\nIn the period 2010-19, life expectancy progress slowed in England, as discussed at the MSOA level in Chapter 4, with three districts experiencing a decline in female life expectancy. For women, lung cancer switched from generally contributing negatively to the change in district life expectancy (Figure 6.15 (a)) to positively (Figure 6.15 (b)). The contribution for the other cancer groups was similar for the two time periods. There were a larger number of districts with positive contributions for all other NCDs in the second period. The positive contribution from all the CVD groups (ischaemic heart disease, stroke, all other CVD) was weaker for the second time period as the negative forcing effect of Alzheimer’s and other dementias strengthened massively. In the years 2010 to 2019, the inequality in progress between districts was driven largely by Alzheimer’s and all other NCD, both with a difference in contribution between the 10th and 90th percentile districts of 3.0 years.\nFor men, the contribution for all cancers groups, including lung cancer, maintained the same picture in each time period. As for women, the slowdown in progress was driven by reductions in the contribution from CVDs in the second time period and the strong negative contributions from Alzheimer’s and other dementias. Injuries, which contributed positively to life expectancy increases in 2002-10 for all districts, saw a reversal with all but 19 districts contributing negatively. In the latter period, ischaemic heart disease, Alzheimer’s and other dementias, and all other NCD were driving the inequality in progress between districts, with differences in contribution between the 10th and 90th percentile districts of 2.8, 2.9 and 3.0 years respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Women, 2002-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Women, 2010-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Men, 2002-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Men, 2010-19\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.15: Contributions of deaths from specific causes to life expectancy difference between the district populations in 2002 and 2010, and in 2010 and 2019, in 314 districts in England.

    "section": "6.3 Discussion",
    "text": "6.3 Discussion\nThis analysis revealed huge inequalities in mortality for a wide-ranging variety of causes of death in England. In particular, although there were widespread declines in CVDs, there have been huge increases in Alzheimer’s and other dementias, which in 2019 became one of the most unequal causes of death, with 4.1- and 3.6-fold differences for women and men between the highest and lowest districts. I found that the slowdown in life expectancy gains since around 2010 has been driven largely by Alzheimer’s and other dementias and all other NCD in women, and by ischaemic heart disease, Alzheimer’s and other dementias, and all other NCD in men.\n\n6.3.1 Strengths and limitations\nThe work presents trends in cause-specific mortality over a period of substantial policy interest at the district level, and uncovers which causes of death have been driving the slowdown in progress since 2010.\nThe study was carried out at the district level rather than for MSOAs, which masks substantial heterogeneity and was the motivation for the all-cause mortality study in Chapter 4. However, when stratifying further by cause of death, the number of deaths in each age-space-time-cause stratum can be extremely small, even at the district level, which makes the estimation task difficult. Furthermore, running a model that takes a day of GPU time to reach convergence for all causes at the MSOA level for 34 cause-sex combinations is extremely computationally demanding.\nThis study did not look at age- and cause-specific contributions to life expectancy inequality, unlike Bennett et al. (2018), and instead collapsed over age groups. Although this masks some variation, the groups were selected based on the total number of deaths from 2002 to 2019, and are consequently skewed towards older ages, and the age-specific contributions of (e.g.) dementias are not particularly interesting.\nThere is always the desire the split the residual groups into more and more causes of death. For example, there are interesting patterns in the change of all other IMPN (Figure 6.11 (a)), and it would be interesting to understand further how the component causes of all other NCD are driving the inequality in progress (Figure 6.15). Moreover, there has been a lot of recent attention in the literature on “deaths of despair” – deaths from drug overdose, suicide or alcoholic liver disease – in the UK (Angus et al., 2023) and the US (Case and Deaton, 2015), and it would of interest to separate injuries into intentional and unintentional. However, the groupings were chosen based on a total mortality rule to prevent the number of deaths in each cause group from becoming too small.\nIt would have been desirable, albeit computationally challenging, to run all cause groups in a single joint model. When calculating contributions using Arriaga’s method, mortality for each cause group was scaled such that the sum across all causes equalled to the estimate for total mortality. This would not be necessary if cause-specific mortality were estimated jointly as the causes of death would adjust amongst each other each iteration to sum to total mortality. Foreman et al. (2017) jointly forecasted cause-specific death rates for states in the US, but instead estimated each age group separately.\nUnlike Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, migration was not as much of an issue at the district level. As van Dijk et al. (2021) explain, “the majority of moves occur over short distances: the 2011 Census records that 57.1% of the individuals aged 16 and over that changed address within the preceding 12 months moved within the same local authority district.”\n\n\n6.3.2 Comparison with previous literature\nThere are two key studies in the literature which break the population of England down into subgroups and look at the cause-composition of mortality: Firstly, from my research group, Bennett et al. (2018) divided the population by deciles of deprivation and looked at largely similar groups of causes to this chapter. The authors found the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived areas was caused by the large contributions of respiratory diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and a set of preventable and treatable cancers. Unlike the present work, the authors broke the results down further by age, finding that deaths in children younger than 5 years and dementias in older ages drove the inequality between the top and bottom deciles.\nSecondly, using data from one of the first GBD studies of subnational populations, Steel et al. (2018) looked at trends in mortality of 150 upper tier local authorities, which are larger than the districts used in this chapter, but considered a massive 264 causes of deaths, relying heavily on covariates in the model to produce estimates for areas with little to no data on more obscure causes. As with Bennett et al. (2018) and the work here, the GBD group found the rate of improvement in life expectancy had slowed since 2010. They found, in general, the slowdown was driven by the disappearance of sustained annual improvements from ischaemic heart disease, strokes, as in Figure 6.15, but also to a lesser extent from colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. The authors found the annual reduction in mortality attributable to most major risk factors (tobacco, dietary risks, high blood pressure etc) had declined since 1990, but has slowed since 2010, with the exception of alcohol and drug use, which has seen little change since the 2000s.\nBoth these studies focus on what causes of death have driven the inequality between subgroups of the population. I found the causes with the clearest gradients in contribution from the best- to worst-performing districts were those with modifiable risk factors, such as ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer, COPD, and injuries, and also the residual groups of all other NCDs and all other cancers. There were also contributions from Alzheimer’s and other dementias, but these did follow the direction from best- to worst-performing district as obviously as the aforementioned causes. The work in this chapter extends previous studies by also considering which causes of death have driven the the inequality in progress between subgroups of the population."

I used the top ten leading cancer causes of death according to the total number of deaths from 2002 to 2019 for cause-specific analysis, as well as a residual group comprising all other cancer deaths. As a result, the residual group in this chapter is smaller than in Chapter 6. The full list of ICD-10 codes for each cause group can be found in Table D.2.\nI ran a model for a combined group of all cancer deaths, which resulted in near-identical median estimates of probability of dying to those created by summing the age-district-year-cause specific death rates over all the cancer groups (correlation coefficient across all years 0.99 for both sexes). I present results from the model as the credible intervals are directly estimated.\nThe primary reporting outcome is, again, the unconditional probability of dying between birth and 80 years of age. I also report the mean age at death among those who died of that cause. Details on the calculations for both the probability of dying and the mean age at death can be found in Appendix A."

    "text": "8.1 Public health and policy implications of findings\nAlthough previous studies have observed a decline in female life expectancy in the bottom two deciles of deprivation in the past decade (Bennett et al., 2018; Marmot et al., 2020), this thesis has shown both for men and women where the declines have been happening for small areas. Not only have there been declines, but the declines have been accelerating in the latter half of the decade, such that in the period 2014-19, life expectancy fell 1 in 5 MSOAs for women and 1 in 9 for men. These trends happened in the years before the mortality-forcing event of the Covid-19 pandemic and are worse than comparable countries (Leon et al., 2019), and should be deemed a failure for public health policy. Although the complexity of policy means it cannot be proved casually, leaders within the NHS have pointed towards constrained funding for the healthcare body itself, as well as cuts to wider social determinants, such as housing and education, as the main reason for the country’s poor performance (Ham, 2023).\nThe declines in life expectancy were sustained over a long period of time, which serves as another example where death rates for some population subgroups run contrary to the persistent mortality decline of the third stage of the Epidemiologic Transition theory, as discussed in Gaylin and Kates (1997) with the HIV/AIDS pandemic. And even if England is in the hypothesised fourth stage of the transition, the Age of Delayed Degenerative diseases (Olshansky and Ault, 1986), there are subnational patterns where degenerative diseases are not killing at later and later ages. The difference in progress between districts in the last decade was largely driven by differences in these degenerative diseases. In particular, the rate of improvement for CVD and all other NCDs, and the strength of the negative forcing effect of Alzheimer’s and other dementias. Furthermore, female mortality from infectious, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (GBD group 1), which dominate the second stage of the transition, increased in many districts. There is also worrying shift towards injuries (GBD group 3) contributing negatively towards life expectancy progress, particularly for men. This is possibly driven by a rise in “deaths of despair” (Angus et al., 2023; Case and Deaton, 2015), although this would require further analysis by stratifying into intentional and unintentional injuries. It should be noted that IMPN and injuries do not play a major role in total mortality as they accounted for only 11.1% of all deaths from 2002 to 2019, but they are almost entirely preventable and should be addressed through appropriate policy.\nCancer survival outcomes in the UK are worse than those in Europe in general (OECD, 2016). In this thesis, I found mortality showed huge spatial variation for a number of preventable cancers. Worryingly, at the same level of poverty, London performed significantly better that the rest of the country for several cancers. This suggests either regional differences in the quality of care, or differences in the populations living in deprived areas, which should both be the subject for policy discussions.\nFinally, this thesis emphasises the value of small area work in informing policy. National trends in mortality are not spatially homogenous. Particular diseases have shown massive variation at the district level, such as COPD in women (6.0-fold in 2019), and by studying England at the MSOA level, I have uncovered the widest subnational gap in life expectancy of 27.0 years (men in 2019) in the literature. This rich source of data allows policy makers to work with local authorities to create targeted public health interventions. The population issues at the LSOA level in London and the coding of CVD on the Isle of Wight show there are still limitations of the data. Nevertheless, the estimates from this thesis are already being used in the press to provide context for recent falls in US life expectancy (Burn-Murdoch, 2023), and I hope they are also being discussed by policymakers."

    "section": "8.2 Future work",
    "text": "8.2 Future work\nThere are many possible substantive and methodological extensions to the work presented in this thesis. Firstly, on the substantive side, there is a reason the final year of study period was restricted at 2019 that has nothing to do with the availability of civil registration data for the proceeding years: the Covid-19 pandemic. It would be naïve to fit the same model to an extended time period that includes the pandemic years because the pandemic had such a major influence on mortality patterns. The model relies heavily on linear trends, which would be affected by the final years. Further, pandemics are fat-tailed events, so the Gaussian random walk effects would struggle to capture the shock without increasing the overall variance of the effect.\nRather than extending the study to include the pandemic years and look at the trends between 2002 and 2023, a more interesting question is “had the pandemic not happened, how would mortality patterns be different?” This would be done using a counterfactual analysis: train a model to estimate annual mortality from 2002 to 2019 and produce a forecast for the years from 2020. A team, including myself, has already done this analysis at the national level at a weekly temporal resolution (Kontis et al., 2022, 2020). Here, the task would instead involve forecasts for each sex-age-space-time-cause stratum on annual timescales. The group has been involved in a number of mortality forecasting projects (Bennett et al., 2015; Foreman et al., 2017; Kontis et al., 2017). The models are similar to those in this thesis, but would need to be adapted and trained specifically for forecasting purposes, with the possibility of averaging multiple models to reduce bias. The results would allow us to see how the cause-composition of mortality has changed compared to the business as usual scenario. We would obviously expect and increase in deaths infectious disease, but were injuries reduced as the country was locked down in their homes? Did cancer outcomes worsen due to missed surgeries as hospitals were flooded with Covid-19 patients? Is there a longer term effect due to strain on emergency services, which has manifested in longer waiting lists and waiting times for appointments (Dorling, 2023)? And, how have these effects varied for different age groups and different areas of the country?\nIn theory, with improvements both to hardware and the rise of approximate inference algorithms to replace computationally costly sampling methods, the models can be scaled to higher and higher spatial resolutions and we could potentially estimate mortality for the entire country for LSOAs, OAs, or even postcodes. However, given the data issues in Chapter 5, perhaps bigger is not better when the quality of the data is lacking.\nOne of the major strengths of the thesis was the use of Bayesian methods, at one of the highest spatial resolutions in the literature for a model estimating mortality. This was largely thanks to recent developments in probabilistic programming, which allow sampling to run on GPUs rather than CPUs, and is generally faster for models with over 10,000 parameters (Lao et al., 2020). The models themselves, which were based on previous work in the group (Bennett et al., 2018, 2015), followed traditional statistical approaches using intercepts and linear slopes and adding in random walk effects for non-linearities. However, with models such as Equation 4.3, we are actually only interested in the left-hand side of the equation – the death rate – and not at all in the values of the parameters on the right-hand side. There are a vast array of flexible models which can describe complex data without needing to design heavily parametrised structures. These range from Gaussian processes (Flaxman et al., 2015; Rasmussen and Williams, 2006), where the user can use inductive biases and their own knowledge to influence how the model fits the data, to wilder options like neural networks, which completely sacrifice any remaining interpretability of the effects.\nDuring my PhD, I became very familiar with the literature on Gaussian processes, and was involved with a paper aimed at speeding up inference in spatial settings (Semenova et al., 2022). One of the most promising avenues for the task of mortality estimation in this thesis, outlined in Flaxman et al. (2015), is the use of Kronecker-structured covariance matrices to create hierarchical Gaussian processes. In there context of this thesis, the covariance matrix would be defined as the Kronecker product of three smaller matrices: one for age effects, one for spatial effects, and one for temporal effects. We can exploit the Kronecker structure for faster inference, as we no longer need to invert the full matrix (an operation that scales cubically with the number of data points), but rather the smaller constituent matrices of each effect. Ultimately, nothing came to fruition as the working environment due to the sensitivity of the data1 was not conducive to developing novel statistical methods. Also, there was no guarantee the Gaussian process methods would be quicker, as it still requires the inversion of a large spatial matrix, nor would it produce a result much different from the original model. Instead, I allocated time to scaling existing models and testing new hardware. I believe the hierarchical Gaussian process model should be the starting point for future research because it is much more flexible and requires less testing of each effect than the models in this thesis.\nAnother methodological extension would be to model causes of death jointly, thereby borrowing strength across causes. Diseases often share common risk factors and similar aetiologies, so there often is some redundancy in specifying a unique spatial surface for each cause. In the disease mapping literature, studies have built spatial models which share spatial components between diseases. Firstly, Knorr-Held and Best (2001) considered a model (also described in Best et al. (2005)) for two diseases, with disease-specific spatial components and one shared component. Held et al. (2005) generalised this approach to model any number of diseases as a weighted sum of shared components. Rather than a general approach, both Downing et al. (2008) and Mahaki et al. (2018) allocated the spatial components to the diseases a priori based on knowledge of the common risk factors between cancers such as smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption. Foreman et al. (2017) allowed for more variability by modelling interactions between each spatial unit and cause. There is also the option to extend the hierarchical Gaussian process described above with another component covariance matrix describing the correlations between each of the cause groups. Ultimately, the goal would be to run a single joint model that flexibly describes interactions between sexes, age groups, spatial units, time, and causes of death.\n\n\n\n\n\nAngus C, Buckley C, Tilstra AM, Dowd JB. 2023.

    "text": "A.1 Period life tables\nCalculating life expectancy for a cohort is possible, but you have to wait until every member of the cohort as died. Instead, demographers use period (or “current”) life tables, which consider what would happen to a hypothetical cohort that are subjected to the deaths rates in each age group at an exact period in time. Life tables can be constructed using discrete age bands starting at age \\(x\\) and ending at age \\(x+n\\). We supply the age-specific death rates, \\({}_{n}m_{x}\\), and the average person-years lived by those dying in the interval, \\({}_{n}a_{x}\\), and the life table calculates the mean age at death – the life expectancy, \\(e_x\\).\nWe start with a hypotethical cohort of size \\(l_0 = 100,000\\) and sequentially apply the probability of dying in each age group, calculated as \\[\n{}_{n}q_{x} = \\frac{n \\cdot {}_{n}m_{x}}{1 + (n - {}_{n}a_{x}) {}_{n}m_{x}}.\n\\tag{A.1}\\] The open interval \\({}_{\\infty}q_{x} = 1\\), as nobody is immortal. Using the probability of surviving in each age group, \\({}_{n}p_{x} = 1 - {}_{n}q_{x}\\), the number of survivors is given by \\[\nl_{x+n} = l_x \\cdot {}_{n}p_{x}.\n\\tag{A.2}\\]\nThe number of person-years lived is the sum of the number of survivors weighted by the band width and number of people who died weighted by \\({}_{n}a_{x}\\) \\[\n{}_{n}L_{x} = n l_x \\cdot + {}_{n}a_{x} l_{x} {}_{n}q_{x} \\quad {}_{\\infty}L_{x} = \\frac{l_x}{{}_{\\infty}m_{x}},\n\\tag{A.3}\\]\nand the total number of person-years lived above \\(x\\) is \\[\nT_{x} = \\sum^{\\infty}_{x = a} {}_{n}L_{x}.\n\\tag{A.4}\\]\nThen, life expectancy is given by diving the number of person-years lived by the number of people who will live them \\[\ne_x = \\frac{T_x}{l_x}.\n\\tag{A.5}\\]\nThroughout the thesis, I only consider life expectancy at birth.\n\nA.1.1 The very young ages and the very old ages\nOn average, it’s a good approximation is to assume deaths occur halfway through the age interval: \\({}_{n}a_{x} = n /2\\). But for younger ages, particularly at lower levels of mortality, the majority of infant deaths lie further towards the earliest stages of infancy. Coale and Demeny used regression on a series of international datasets to recommend suitable values for \\({}_{1}a_{0}\\) and \\({}_{4}a_{1}\\) instead of the midpoint (Coale et al., 1983).\nThe start of the open age group can be many years away from some of the ages at death, particularly in ageing populations. In order to produce reliable estimates of death rates at high ages, I used the Kannisto-­Thatcher method to expand the terminal age group (\\(\\geq 85\\) years) of the life table and adjust \\({}_{n}a_{x}\\) above 70 years (Thatcher et al., 2002)."

Note, even for the smallest death rates, \\({}_{\\infty}q^i_{x} = 1\\) – if you live to infinity, you’ll die of it eventually."
