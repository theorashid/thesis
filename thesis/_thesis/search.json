The bits that look like $book.university$ say are Pandoc and are referencing variables in the _quarto.yml file. Knowing that, you should be able to figure out what is happening.\nThere are plenty of written comments that explain what pages, sections and formatting the code is creating. Each major document element is divided into commented blocks with titles in all capitals to make it obvious what the following bit of code is doing. Initially there seems to be a lot of code, but this is all formatting, and it has all been taken care of so you don’t have to do it.\nMany of the sections have $if(...)$ so that the section is only included if you included information for that in _quarto.yml.\nIn the _quarto.yml, pdf: toc: false is used so that Quarto/Pandoc doesn’t add a table of contents. This template puts the table of contents before the abbreviations and symbols pages and Quarto/Pandoc doesn’t let us control where it puts the table of contents. So we have to add the TOC manually for pdf and pass in toc: false.\nThe list of figures and tables are all taken care of for you and do not need to be manually created or edited. The next set of pages are more likely to be optional and can be deleted since they are for a more technical thesis: insert a list of abbreviations you have used in the thesis, then a list of the physical constants and numbers you refer to and finally, a list of mathematical symbols used in any formulae. Making the effort to fill these tables means the reader has a one-stop place to refer to instead of searching the internet and references to try and find out what you meant by certain abbreviations or symbols.\nThe list of symbols is split into the Roman and Greek alphabets. Whereas the abbreviations and symbols ought to be listed in alphabetical order (and this is not done automatically for you) the list of physical constants should be grouped into similar themes.\nThe next page contains a one line dedication. Who will you dedicate your thesis to?"

Switching to one sided printing is as simple as adding \"oneside\" to classoptions: in the _quarto.yml file. The headers for the pages contain the page number on the outer side (so it is easy to flick through to the page you want) and the chapter name on the inner side.\nThe text is set to 11 point by default with single line spacing, again, you can tune the text size and spacing should you want or need to using the class options. The spacing can be changed similarly by replacing the \"singlespacing\" with \"onehalfspacing\" or \"doublespacing\" in the class options.\n\n\n1.9.2 Using US Letter Paper\nThe paper size used in the template is A4, which is the standard size in Europe. If you are using this thesis template elsewhere and particularly in the United States, then you may have to change the A4 paper size to the US Letter size. This can be by editting geometry: in _quarto.yml in the pdf format section."

    "title": "2  Background",
    "section": "2.1 Small area health statistics (unit)",
    "text": "2.1 Small area health statistics (unit)\nIn 1983, a documentary on the fallout produced from a fire at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria claimed that there was a ten-fold increase in cases of childhood leukaemia in the surrounding community. This anomaly had gone undetected by public health authorities, raising concern that routinely collected data were not able to identify local clusters of disease. The subsequent enquiry confirmed the excess, and recommended that a research unit was set up to monitor small area statistics and respond quickly to ad hoc queries on local health hazards. The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) was established in 1987 (Elliott et al. 1992).\nBeyond producing substantive research studies on environment and health, a core aim of SAHSU is to develop small area statistical methodology (Wakefield and Elliott 1999) for:\n\nPoint source type studies. Is there an increased risk close to an environmental hazard?\nGeographic correlation studies. Is there a correlation between disease risk and environmental variables?\nClustering. Does a disease to produce non-random spatial patterns of incidence? If the aetiology is unknown, this could suggest the disease is infectious.\nDisease mapping. Summarising the spatial variation in risk.\n\nIn a pilot study for SAHSU, Elliott et al. (1992) investigated the mortality from mesothelioma and asbestosis near the Plymouth docks. Death registrations with postcode information were held by SAHSU. Both diseases are related to industrial exposure and asbestos, so concentric circular bands were drawn around the Plymouth dockyards as a way to approximate the exposure from a point source of environmental pollution. There was a clear increase in risk within \\(3km\\) of the docks. A similar distance-based approach was adopted to look at excess respiratory disease mortality near two factories in Barking and Havering (Aylin et al. 1999), kidney disease mortality near chemical plants in Runcorn (Hodgson et al. 2004) In response to public concern over exposure to toxic chemicals in landfill, SAHSU conducted the most extensive study ever into health effects of landfill sites. Postocdes within a \\(2km\\) buffer of a landfill site were classified as exposed. Compared to those living beyond \\(2km\\), SAHSU found a small unexplained excess of congenital anomalies (Elliott, Briggs, et al. 2001), no increase in rates of cancer (Jarup, Briggs, et al. 2002), and no excess risk of Down syndrome (Jarup et al. 2007).\nDistance from source is, however, only a basic model for the exposure, which can often exhibit more complex, directional spatial patterns. A number of SAHSU studies have employed physics-informed models to create an exposure surface, and assess the geographic correlations between this surface and the health outcome, notably for a plume of mercury pollution (Hodgson et al. 2007), exposure to mobile phone base station during pregnancy (Elliott et al. 2010), noise from aircrafts near Heathrow (Hansell et al. 2013), road traffic noise in London (Halonen et al. 2015), and PM10 from incinerators during pregnancy (Parkes et al. 2020). SAHSU published an environment and health atlas for England and Wales, showing the geographic patters of 14 health conditions at census ward level over an aggregated 25 year period alongside five environmental exposure surfaces (Hansell, Anna L. et al. 2014).\n\n2.1.1 Disease mapping at SAHSU\nMany of the studies at SAHSU focus on rare diseases at small areas. The data for the number of cases, or number of deaths, in a region are likely to small numbers. This sparseness issue is even more pertinant when the population is also statified by age group. Rates calculated from observed data present apparent variability between spatial units, which is larger than the true differences in the risk. There is a need for statistical smoothing techniques to obtain robust estimates of rates by sharing information between strata. Aylin et al. (1999) mapped diseases for wards in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster using a simple model that smoothed rates towards the mean of the risks across the region. SAHSU thereafter published a plethora of studies for disease mapping models with explicit spatial dependence, which are designed to give more weight to nearby areas than those further away.\nThere are three main categories for modelling spatial effects. First, we can treat space a continous surface, such as Gaussian processes or splines. Second, we can use areal models, which make use of spatial neighbourhood structure of the units. Thirdly, we can explicitly build effects based on a nested hierarchy of geographical units, for example between state, county and census tract in the US.\nIn the context of disease mapping, events are usually aggregated to areas rather than assigned specific geographical coordinates. Wakefield and Elliott (1999) model aggregated counts as realisations of a Poisson process, in which the expected number of cases is calculated by integrating a continuous surface that generates the cases integrated over the area. The surface was some function of spatially-referenced covariates. Kelsall and Wakefield (2002) describe an alterative model, where the log-transformed risk surface is modelled by a Gaussian process, whose correlation function depends on distance.\nBest, Richardson, and Thomson (2005) provide a review of the use of hierarchical models with spatial dependence for disease mapping. In particular, the authors focus on Bayesian estimation, and different classes of spatial prior distributions.\nThe first prior proposed for spatial effects \\(\\mathbf{S} = {S_1, ..., S_n}\\) is the multivariate normal \\[\n\\mathbf{S} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\pmb{\\mu}, \\pmb{\\Sigma}),\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\pmb{\\mu}\\) is the mean effect vector, \\(\\pmb{\\Sigma} = \\sigma^2 \\pmb{\\Omega}\\) and \\(\\pmb{\\Omega}\\) is a symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix defining the correlation between spatial units. A common choice when specifying the structure of the correlation matrix is to assume a function that decays with the distance between the centroids of the areas, so that places nearby in space share similar disease profiles. Note, this is mathematically equivalent to the practical implementation of a Gaussian process, whcih uses a finite set of points. An example in Elliott, Wakefield, et al. (2001) chooses the exponential decay function to map cancer risk in northwest England.\nA more popular prior is the conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior, also known as a Gaussian Markov random field. These form a joint distribution as in Equation 2.1, but the covariance is usually defined instead in terms of the preicision matrix \\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\pmb{\\Sigma}^{-1} = \\tau(\\mathbf{D} - \\rho \\mathbf{A}),\n\\] where \\(\\tau\\) controls the overall precision of the effects, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the spatial adjacency matrix formed by the small areas, \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is a diagonal matrix with entries equal to the number of neighbours for each spatial unit, and the autocorrelation parameter \\(\\rho\\) describes the amount of correlation. This can be seen as a tuning the degree of spatial dependence, where \\(\\rho = 0\\) implies independence between areas, and \\(\\rho = 1\\) full dependence. The case with \\(\\rho = 1\\) is called the intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model. Besag, York, and Mollié (1991) proposed the model (hereafter called BYM) \\[\nS_i = U_i + V_i,\n\\tag{2.2}\\] where \\(U_i\\) follow an ICAR distribution, and \\(V_i\\) are independent and identically distributed random effects. The BYM distribution was employed to model spatial variation in the relative risk of testicular (Toledano et al. 2001) and prostate (Jarup, Best, et al. 2002) cancers for small areas in regions of England.\nFurther disease mapping studies at SAHSU have also looked at age patterns and trends over time of disease. Asaria et al. (2012) analysed cardiovasuclar disease death rates by fitting a spatial model for all wards in England separately for each age group and time period. Bennett et al. (2015) considered a model to estimate spatial, age group and temporal effects jointly for all-cause mortality in England at the district level.\nIn building models which consider the hierarchy of geographical units, these relationships are often incorporated into the model as a nested hierarchy of random effects. These models account for which spatial units lie within common administrative boundaries, but, by design, there is no knowledge of spatial distance included. This is often a desirable property of the model for certain geographies, like states in the US, which are administrative. Policy is decided at these geographies, so there is reason to believe these boundaries may have a greater effect on health outcomes than spatial structure. Although not used in previous SAHSU studies, Finucane et al. (2014) demonstrate how country-level blood pressure can be modelled as such, in this case exploiting the hierarchy global, subregion, region and country. Note, although these models group by geographical region, these models are not spatial as they do not contain any information on the position relative to other units.\n\n\n2.1.2 Small area analyses of mortality (over space, but also time age)\nPopulation issue, measuring between census, migration.
