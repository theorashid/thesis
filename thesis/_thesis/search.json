Gunn from the University of Southampton (UK), department of Electronics and Computer Science. You can find his original thesis style file at his site, here: http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~srg/softwaretools/document/templates/.\nSteve’s ecsthesis.cls was then taken by Sunil Patel who modified it by creating a skeleton framework and folder structure to place the thesis files in. The resulting template can be found on Sunil’s site here: http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/thesis-template.\nSunil’s template was made available through LaTeXTemplates where it was modified many times based on user requests and questions. Version 2.0 and onwards of this template represents a major modification to Sunil’s template and is, in fact, hardly recognisable. The work to make version 2.0 possible was carried out by Vel (vel@latextemplates.com) and Johannes Böttcher."

    "text": "1.6 The tex\\before-body.tex File Explained\nThe tex\\before-body.tex file contains the structure of the thesis and is a mix of Pandoc template and code. The bits that look like $book.university$ say are Pandoc and are referencing variables in the _quarto.yml file. Knowing that, you should be able to figure out what is happening.\nThere are plenty of written comments that explain what pages, sections and formatting the code is creating. Each major document element is divided into commented blocks with titles in all capitals to make it obvious what the following bit of code is doing. Initially there seems to be a lot of code, but this is all formatting, and it has all been taken care of so you don’t have to do it.\nMany of the sections have $if(...)$ so that the section is only included if you included information for that in _quarto.yml.\nIn the _quarto.yml, pdf: toc: false is used so that Quarto/Pandoc doesn’t add a table of contents. This template puts the table of contents before the abbreviations and symbols pages and Quarto/Pandoc doesn’t let us control where it puts the table of contents. So we have to add the TOC manually for pdf and pass in toc: false.\nThe list of figures and tables are all taken care of for you and do not need to be manually created or edited. The next set of pages are more likely to be optional and can be deleted since they are for a more technical thesis: insert a list of abbreviations you have used in the thesis, then a list of the physical constants and numbers you refer to and finally, a list of mathematical symbols used in any formulae. Making the effort to fill these tables means the reader has a one-stop place to refer to instead of searching the internet and references to try and find out what you meant by certain abbreviations or symbols.\nThe list of symbols is split into the Roman and Greek alphabets. Whereas the abbreviations and symbols ought to be listed in alphabetical order (and this is not done automatically for you) the list of physical constants should be grouped into similar themes.\nThe next page contains a one line dedication. Who will you dedicate your thesis to?"

You may see a warning about this in the compilation log and, if your references contain unicode characters, they may not show up correctly or at all. One solution to this is to use the biber backend instead of the outdated bibtex backend. This is done by finding this in tex/in-header.tex: backend=bibtex and changing it to backend=biber. Google a bit to find information on this."

Switching to one sided printing is as simple as adding \"oneside\" to classoptions: in the _quarto.yml file. The headers for the pages contain the page number on the outer side (so it is easy to flick through to the page you want) and the chapter name on the inner side.\nThe text is set to 11 point by default with single line spacing, again, you can tune the text size and spacing should you want or need to using the class options. The spacing can be changed similarly by replacing the \"singlespacing\" with \"onehalfspacing\" or \"doublespacing\" in the class options.\n\n\n1.9.2 Using US Letter Paper\nThe paper size used in the template is A4, which is the standard size in Europe. If you are using this thesis template elsewhere and particularly in the United States, then you may have to change the A4 paper size to the US Letter size. This can be by editting geometry: in _quarto.yml in the pdf format section."

    "section": "2.1 The Small Area Health Statistics Unit",
    "text": "2.1 The Small Area Health Statistics Unit\nIn 1983, a documentary on the fallout produced from a fire at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria claimed that there was a ten-fold increase in cases of childhood leukaemia in the surrounding community. This anomaly had gone undetected by public health authorities, raising concern that routinely collected data were not able to identify local clusters of disease. The subsequent enquiry confirmed the excess, and recommended that a research unit was set up to monitor small area statistics and respond quickly to ad hoc queries on local health hazards. The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) was established in 1987 (P. Elliott et al. 1992).\nBeyond producing substantive research studies on environment and health, a core aim of SAHSU was to develop small area statistical methodology. In particular, methods of:\n\nDisease mapping. Summarising the spatial variation in risk.\nGeographic correlation studies. Is there a correlation between disease risk and environmental variables?\nPoint source type studies, Is there an increased risk close to an environmental hazard?\nClustering. Does a disease to produce non-random spatial patterns of incidence? If the aetiology is unknown, this could suggest the disease is infectious.\n\nThe focus for many of the studies were rare diseases at small areas, so there was a need for statistical smoothing, in particular Bayesian methods (Best, Richardson, and Thomson 2005; Wakefield and Elliott 1999; Paul Elliott et al. 2001).\nElliot 1992.

This work was initiated due to public concern over whether humans are exposed to toxic chemicals in landfill (which accounts for over 80% of municipal waste in Britain) and suffer adverse health consequences as a result [1-5]. The rates of birth defects, low birthweight, stillbirths, and of certain cancers in populations living within 2km of landfill sites were studied.
