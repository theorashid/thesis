## Small Area Health Statistics (Unit)

In 1983, a documentary on the fallout produced from a fire at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria claimed that there was a ten-fold increase in cases of childhood leukaemia in the surrounding community.
This anomaly had gone undetected by public health authorities, raising concern that routinely collected data were not able to identify local clusters of disease.
The subsequent enquiry confirmed the excess, and recommended that a research unit was set up to monitor small area statistics and respond quickly to _ad hoc_ queries on local health hazards.
The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) was established in 1987 [@elliottSmallAreaHealth1992].

Beyond producing substantive research studies on environment and health, a core aim of SAHSU is to develop small area statistical methodology [@wakefieldIssuesStatisticalAnalysis1999] for:

- _Point source type studies_. Is there an increased risk close to an environmental hazard?
- _Geographic correlation studies_. Is there a correlation between disease risk and environmental variables?
- _Clustering_. Does a disease to produce non-random spatial patterns of incidence? If the aetiology is unknown, this could suggest the disease is infectious.
- _Disease mapping_. Summarising the spatial variation in risk.

In a pilot study for SAHSU, @elliottSmallAreaHealth1992 investigated the mortality from mesothelioma and asbestosis near the Plymouth docks.
Death registrations with postcode information were held by SAHSU.
Both diseases are related to industrial exposure and asbestos, so concentric circular bands were drawn around the Plymouth dockyards as a way to approximate the exposure from a point source of environmental pollution.
There was a clear increase in risk within $3km$ of the docks.
A similar distance-based approach was adopted to look at excess respiratory disease mortality near two factories in Barking and Havering [@aylinNationalFacilitySmall1999], kidney disease mortality near chemical plants in Runcorn [@hodgsonExcessRiskKidney2004]
In response to public concern over exposure to toxic chemicals in landfill, SAHSU conducted the most extensive study ever into health effects of landfill sites.
Postocdes within a $2km$ buffer of a landfill site were classified as exposed.
Compared to those living beyond $2km$, SAHSU found a small unexplained excess of congenital anomalies [@elliottRiskAdverseBirth2001], no increase in rates of cancer [@jarupCancerRisksPopulations2002], and no excess risk of Down syndrome [@jarupSyndromeBirthsLandfill2007].

Distance from source is, however, only a basic model for the exposure, which can often exhibit more complex, directional spatial patterns.
A number of SAHSU studies have employed physics-informed models to create an exposure surface, and assess the geographic correlations between this surface and the health outcome, notably for a plume of mercury pollution [@hodgsonAssessmentExposureMercury2007], exposure to mobile phone base station during pregnancy [@elliottMobilePhoneBase2010], noise from aircrafts near Heathrow [@hansellAircraftNoiseCardiovascular2013], road traffic noise in London [@halonenRoadTrafficNoise2015], and PM10 from incinerators during pregnancy [@parkesRiskCongenitalAnomalies2020].
SAHSU published an environment and health atlas for England and Wales, showing the geographic patters of 14 health conditions at census ward level over an aggregated 25 year period alongside five environmental exposure surfaces [@hansellannal.EnvironmentHealthAtlas2014].

### Disease mapping

The focus for many of the studies were rare diseases at small areas, so there was a need for statistical smoothing, in particular Bayesian methods [@bestComparisonBayesianSpatial2005; @elliottSpatialEpidemiologyMethods2001].

Best 2005 focuses on disease mapping. Discuss the different methods proposed

Correlation matrix MVN, using centroids, function of distance (Spatial epi book application to disease mapping).
Gaussian Markov Random Field (CAR). BYM model.
Gaussian processes.
Hierarchcial model, Foreman 2012. Exploit hierarchical structure

Statistics of spatial modelling. Gaussian processes etc Kyle's thesis.
