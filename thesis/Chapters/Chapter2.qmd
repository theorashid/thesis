# Background {#sec-Chapter2}

## Small area health statistics (unit)

In 1983, a documentary on the fallout produced from a fire at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria claimed that there was a ten-fold increase in cases of childhood leukaemia in the surrounding community.
This anomaly had gone undetected by public health authorities, raising concern that routinely collected data were not able to identify local clusters of disease.
The subsequent enquiry confirmed the excess, and recommended that a research unit was set up to monitor small area statistics and respond quickly to _ad hoc_ queries on local health hazards.
The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) was established in 1987 [@elliottSmallAreaHealth1992].

Beyond producing substantive research studies on environment and health, a core aim of SAHSU is to develop small area statistical methodology [@wakefieldIssuesStatisticalAnalysis1999] for:

- _Point source type studies_. Is there an increased risk close to an environmental hazard?
- _Geographic correlation studies_. Is there a correlation between disease risk and environmental variables?
- _Clustering_. Does a disease to produce non-random spatial patterns of incidence? If the aetiology is unknown, this could suggest the disease is infectious.
- _Disease mapping_. Summarising the spatial variation in risk.

In a pilot study for SAHSU, @elliottSmallAreaHealth1992 investigated the mortality from mesothelioma and asbestosis near the Plymouth docks.
Death registrations with postcode information were held by SAHSU.
Both diseases are related to industrial exposure and asbestos, so concentric circular bands were drawn around the Plymouth dockyards as a way to approximate the exposure from a point source of environmental pollution.
There was a clear increase in risk within $3km$ of the docks.
A similar distance-based approach was adopted to look at excess respiratory disease mortality near two factories in Barking and Havering [@aylinNationalFacilitySmall1999], kidney disease mortality near chemical plants in Runcorn [@hodgsonExcessRiskKidney2004]
In response to public concern over exposure to toxic chemicals in landfill, SAHSU conducted the most extensive study ever into health effects of landfill sites.
Postocdes within a $2km$ buffer of a landfill site were classified as exposed.
Compared to those living beyond $2km$, SAHSU found a small unexplained excess of congenital anomalies [@elliottRiskAdverseBirth2001], no increase in rates of cancer [@jarupCancerRisksPopulations2002], and no excess risk of Down syndrome [@jarupSyndromeBirthsLandfill2007].

Distance from source is, however, only a basic model for the exposure, which can often exhibit more complex, directional spatial patterns.
A number of SAHSU studies have employed physics-informed models to create an exposure surface, and assess the geographic correlations between this surface and the health outcome, notably for a plume of mercury pollution [@hodgsonAssessmentExposureMercury2007], exposure to mobile phone base station during pregnancy [@elliottMobilePhoneBase2010], noise from aircrafts near Heathrow [@hansellAircraftNoiseCardiovascular2013], road traffic noise in London [@halonenRoadTrafficNoise2015], and PM10 from incinerators during pregnancy [@parkesRiskCongenitalAnomalies2020].
SAHSU published an environment and health atlas for England and Wales, showing the geographic patters of 14 health conditions at census ward level over an aggregated 25 year period alongside five environmental exposure surfaces [@hansellannal.EnvironmentHealthAtlas2014].

### Disease mapping

The focus for many of the studies at SAHSU were rare diseases at small areas.
The data for the number of cases, or number of deaths, in a given small area is likely to be zero or near zero.
This sparseness issue is even more pertinant when the study population is statified by age group.
Rates calculated from observed data present apparent variability between spatial units, which is larger than the true differences in the risk.
In these cases, there is a need for statistical smoothing techniques to obtain stable estimates of rates by sharing information between strata.
@aylinNationalFacilitySmall1999 mapped statistically-smoothed diseases for wards in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster using a simple model that smoothing towards the mean of the risks across the region.
Later studies at SAHSU focussed on models with explicit spatial dependence, which are designed to weight the influence of nearby areas more than those further away.

Broadly, there are three main categories for modelling spatial effects.
Firstly, we can treat a space a continous surface.
Second, we can use areal models with spatial neighbourhood dependence.
Thirdly, we can model a nested hierarchy of geographical units.

In the context disease mapping, events are usually aggregated to small areas rather than assigned specific geographical coordinates.
@wakefieldIssuesStatisticalAnalysis1999 model aggregated counts as realisations of a Poisson process, in which the  by specify the expected number of cases, i.e. the mean of a Poisson distribution, is some continuous surface generating the cases integrated over the area.
The continuous surface was some function of spatially-referenced covariates.
@kelsallModelingSpatialVariation2002 describe an alterative model, where the log-transformed risk surface is modelled by a Gaussian process, whose correlation function depends on distance.

$$
\int_{A_i}{\lambda (\mathbf{x})}
$$ {#eq-ctl}

@bestComparisonBayesianSpatial2005 provide a review of the use of hierarchical models with spatial dependence that have been used for disease mapping.
In particular, SAHSU focus on Bayesian estimation, and different classes of spatial prior distributions.

The first prior proposed for spatial effects $\mathbf{S} = {S_1, ..., S_n}$ is the multivariate normal
$$
\mathbf{S} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma}),
$$ {#eq-MVN}

where $\mathbf{\Sigma} = \sigma^2 \mathbf{\Omega}$ and $\mathbf{\Omega}$ defines the correlation between spatial effects.
A common choice for the structure of the correlation matrix is to assume a function that decays with the distance between the centroids of the areas, so that places nearby in space share similar disease profiles.
An example in @elliottSpatialEpidemiologyMethods2001 chooses the exponential decay function to map cancer risk in northwest England.

A more popular prior is the conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior, or Markov random field. These form a joint distribution as in @eq-MVN, but the covariance is usually defined instead in terms of the preicision matrix
$$
\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} = \mathbf{D}(\mathbb{1} - \rho)\mathbf{A},
$$
where $\mathbf{A}$ is the spatial adjacency matrix formed by the small areas, $\mathbf{D}$ is a diagonal matrix with entries equal to the number of neighbours for each spatial unit, and the autocorrelation parameter $\rho$ described the amount of correlation. This can be seen as a trade off between independence between areas when $\rho = 0$, and full dependence when $\rho = 1$.
The case with $\rho = 1$ is called the intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR).
Besag et al. proposed the model (hereafter called BYM)
$$
S_i = U_i + V_i,
$$ {#eq-BYM}
where $U_i$ follow an ICAR distribution, and $V_i$ are iid spatially unstructured effects.
Here are some papers by SAHSU which used BYM

Thirdly, we can model a nested hierarchy of geographical units Hierarchcial model, Foreman 2012. Exploit hierarchical structure
