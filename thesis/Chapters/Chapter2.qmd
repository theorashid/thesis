## Small area health statistics (unit)

In 1983, a documentary on the fallout produced from a fire at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria claimed that there was a ten-fold increase in cases of childhood leukaemia in the surrounding community.
This anomaly had gone undetected by public health authorities, raising concern that routinely collected data were not able to identify local clusters of disease.
The subsequent enquiry confirmed the excess, and recommended that a research unit was set up to monitor small area statistics and respond quickly to _ad hoc_ queries on local health hazards.
The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) was established in 1987 [@elliottSmallAreaHealth1992].

Beyond producing substantive research studies on environment and health, a core aim of SAHSU is to develop small area statistical methodology [@wakefieldIssuesStatisticalAnalysis1999] for:

- _Point source type studies_. Is there an increased risk close to an environmental hazard?
- _Geographic correlation studies_. Is there a correlation between disease risk and environmental variables?
- _Clustering_. Does a disease to produce non-random spatial patterns of incidence? If the aetiology is unknown, this could suggest the disease is infectious.
- _Disease mapping_. Summarising the spatial variation in risk.

In a pilot study for SAHSU, @elliottSmallAreaHealth1992 investigated the mortality from mesothelioma and asbestosis near the Plymouth docks.
Death registrations with postcode information were held by SAHSU.
Both diseases are related to industrial exposure and asbestos, so concentric circular bands were drawn around the Plymouth dockyards as a way to approximate the exposure from a point source of environmental pollution.
There was a clear increase in risk within $3km$ of the docks.
A similar distance-based approach was adopted to look at excess respiratory disease mortality near two factories in Barking and Havering [@aylinNationalFacilitySmall1999], kidney disease mortality near chemical plants in Runcorn [@hodgsonExcessRiskKidney2004]
In response to public concern over exposure to toxic chemicals in landfill, SAHSU conducted the most extensive study ever into health effects of landfill sites.
Postocdes within a $2km$ buffer of a landfill site were classified as exposed.
Compared to those living beyond $2km$, SAHSU found a small unexplained excess of congenital anomalies [@elliottRiskAdverseBirth2001], no increase in rates of cancer [@jarupCancerRisksPopulations2002], and no excess risk of Down syndrome [@jarupSyndromeBirthsLandfill2007].

Distance from source is, however, only a basic model for the exposure, which can often exhibit more complex, directional spatial patterns.
A number of SAHSU studies have employed physics-informed models to create an exposure surface, and assess the geographic correlations between this surface and the health outcome, notably for a plume of mercury pollution [@hodgsonAssessmentExposureMercury2007], exposure to mobile phone base station during pregnancy [@elliottMobilePhoneBase2010], noise from aircrafts near Heathrow [@hansellAircraftNoiseCardiovascular2013], road traffic noise in London [@halonenRoadTrafficNoise2015], and PM10 from incinerators during pregnancy [@parkesRiskCongenitalAnomalies2020].
SAHSU published an environment and health atlas for England and Wales, showing the geographic patters of 14 health conditions at census ward level over an aggregated 25 year period alongside five environmental exposure surfaces [@hansellannal.EnvironmentHealthAtlas2014].

### Disease mapping at SAHSU

Many of the studies at SAHSU focus on rare diseases at small areas.
The data for the number of cases, or number of deaths, in a region are likely to small numbers.
This sparseness issue is even more pertinant when the population is also statified by age group.
Rates calculated from observed data present apparent variability between spatial units, which is larger than the true differences in the risk.
There is a need for statistical smoothing techniques to obtain robust estimates of rates by sharing information between strata.
@aylinNationalFacilitySmall1999 mapped diseases for wards in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster using a simple model that smoothed rates towards the mean of the risks across the region.
SAHSU thereafter published a plethora of studies for disease mapping models with explicit spatial dependence, which are designed to give more weight to nearby areas than those further away.

There are three main categories for modelling spatial effects.
First, we can treat space a continous surface, such as Gaussian processes or splines.
Second, we can use areal models, which make use of spatial neighbourhood structure of the units.
Thirdly, we can explicitly build effects based on a nested hierarchy of geographical units, for example between state, county and census tract in the US.

In the context of disease mapping, events are usually aggregated to areas rather than assigned specific geographical coordinates.
@wakefieldIssuesStatisticalAnalysis1999 model aggregated counts as realisations of a Poisson process, in which the expected number of cases is calculated by integrating a continuous surface that generates the cases integrated over the area.
The surface was some function of spatially-referenced covariates.
@kelsallModelingSpatialVariation2002 describe an alterative model, where the log-transformed risk surface is modelled by a Gaussian process, whose correlation function depends on distance.

@bestComparisonBayesianSpatial2005 provide a review of the use of hierarchical models with spatial dependence for disease mapping.
In particular, the authors focus on Bayesian estimation, and different classes of spatial prior distributions.

The first prior proposed for spatial effects $\mathbf{S} = {S_1, ..., S_n}$ is the multivariate normal
$$
\mathbf{S} \sim \mathcal{N}(\pmb{\mu}, \pmb{\Sigma}),
$$ {#eq-MVN}

where $\pmb{\mu}$ is the mean effect vector, $\pmb{\Sigma} = \sigma^2 \pmb{\Omega}$ and $\pmb{\Omega}$ is a symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix defining the correlation between spatial units.
A common choice when specifying the structure of the correlation matrix is to assume a function that decays with the distance between the centroids of the areas, so that places nearby in space share similar disease profiles.
Note, this is mathematically equivalent to the practical implementation of a Gaussian process, whcih uses a finite set of points.
An example in @elliottSpatialEpidemiologyMethods2001 chooses the exponential decay function to map cancer risk in northwest England.

A more popular prior is the conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior, also known as a Gaussian Markov random field.
These form a joint distribution as in @eq-MVN, but the covariance is usually defined instead in terms of the preicision matrix
$$
\mathbf{P} = \pmb{\Sigma}^{-1} = \tau(\mathbf{D} - \rho \mathbf{A}),
$$
where $\tau$ controls the overall precision of the effects, $\mathbf{A}$ is the spatial adjacency matrix formed by the small areas, $\mathbf{D}$ is a diagonal matrix with entries equal to the number of neighbours for each spatial unit, and the autocorrelation parameter $\rho$ describes the amount of correlation.
This can be seen as a tuning the degree of spatial dependence, where $\rho = 0$ implies independence between areas, and $\rho = 1$ full dependence.
The case with $\rho = 1$ is called the intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model.
@besagBayesianImageRestoration1991 proposed the model (hereafter called BYM)
$$
S_i = U_i + V_i,
$$ {#eq-BYM}
where $U_i$ follow an ICAR distribution, and $V_i$ are independent and identically distributed random effects.
The BYM distribution was employed to model spatial variation in the relative risk of testicular [@toledanoSpatialVariationTemporal2001] and prostate [@jarupGeographicalEpidemiologyProstate2002] cancers for small areas in regions of England.

Further disease mapping studies at SAHSU using spatially structured effects have also extended the methdology to look at age patterns and trends over time of disease.
@asariaTrendsInequalitiesCardiovascular2012 analysed cardiovasuclar disease death rates by fitting a spatial model for all wards in England separately for each age group and time period.
@bennettFutureLifeExpectancy2015 considered a model to jointly forecast all-cause mortality for districts in England, age groups and years.
The model used BYM spatial effects and random walk effects over age and time to capture non-linear relationships.
It is also possible to borrow information across causes of death, as applied in @foremanSmallAreaForecasts2017 on forecasting cause-specific mortality for states in the US.
Random walk effects were again used to non-linear temporal effects, a CAR prior was used for spatial effects, and a multivariate normal where the covariance matrix describes the correlation structure between the 15 cause groups.
The model did not, however, share information between age groups.
Although this is not directly a SAHSU study, the model was developed by a several people in the department.

In building models which consider the hierarchy of geographical units, these relationships are often incorporated into the model as a nested hierarchy of random effects.
These models account for which spatial units lie within common administrative boundaries, but, by design, there is no knowledge of spatial distance included.
This is often a desirable property of the model for certain geographies, like states in the US, which are administrative.
Policy is decided at these geographies, so there is reason to believe these boundaries may have a greater effect on health outcomes than spatial structure.
Although not used in previous SAHSU studies, @finucaneBayesianEstimationPopulationLevel2014 demonstrate how country-level blood pressure can be modelled as such, in this case exploiting the hierarchy global, subregion, region and country.
Note, although these models group by geographical region, these models are not spatial as they do not contain any information on the position relative to other units.

## Cause-specific analyses

Research into the decomposition of mortality into all diseases and injuries began in the mid-twentieth century. 

Moriyama in the US. Series by Moriyama and others at the US Public Health Service. 1900-40s, 25 groups of causes of deaths. "One of their key findings was that as public health interventions – such as improvements in water and sanitation and the expanded use of immunizations and quarantines – increased, the burden of mortality began shifting away from communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, typhoid, and measles, and toward non-communicable and chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancers"

Three stages
Three groups of determinants: ecobiological, socioeconomic, medical and other public health technology
"This apparent shift from communicable to non-communicable causes of death was further formalized and expanded upon by Abdel Omran, who in the 1960s and 70s analyzed several centuries’ worth of vital registration data for England (Omran, 1971) – and later the US (Omran, 1977a, 1977b) – in formulating . This theory combined observations on the changing composition of mortality with trends observed in other fields such as economics, demography, and sociology to posit that as a society develops economically and technologically, deaths from more easily preventable diseases subside. As more people live longer, fertility then declines, the mean age of the population increases, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) take on greater prominence among the causes of death."

He termed this the Epidemiologic Transition theory

The burden of mortality decomposition studies has been the remit of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies since 1990 study (Murray and Lopez 1996), usually cross-sectional but sometimes done with trends. Focus on burdens of disease and premature death (example Ezzati 2008).

## Health inequalities in the UK

While the UK is, by global standards, a wealthy nation with relatively high life expectancy, and the breadth of health inequalities are nowhere near the extremes seen in many other countries, the nation suffers still vast, preventible inequalities in mortality and morbidity.
There are several ways to stratify the UK population and comapare inequalities between subgroups.
Here, we focus on class, income, geography, and deprivation.

The notion of class is prominent in UK society, but health outcomes between classes are difficult to separate from other risk factors such as hazards in manual labour or smoking rates.
The Whitehall study of 1967 followed 17,530 men working in the civil service and recorded their mortality over a 10-year period.
@marmotInequalitiesDeathSpecific1984 found, by classifying the civil servants into social class according to their employment grade, there was a three-fold difference in mortality between the highest class, administrators, and men in the lowest class, mainly messengers and unskilled manual workers.
They found, in general, a strong inverse association between grade and mortality – a term Marmot has coined a "social gradient".
The men were working stable, sedentary jobs in the same office building in London, so the gradient could not be fully explained by smoking or industrial exposure alone.
There authors concluded be other factors inherent to social class (defined here by employment), which explain the mortality differences.
A second cohort of Whitehall employees from 1985 to 1988, this time including women as well as men, were screened and asked to answer questions on self-reported ill-health.
@marmotHealthInequalitiesBritish1991 found the social gradient in health had persisted in the 20 years separating the studies.
In 2008, Marmot was asked by the Secretary of State to conduct a review into the state of health inequalities in England and to use the evidence to design policy for reducing these inequalities.
A key plot in the first Marmot Review, released in 2010, depicted the social gradient in mortality for regions in England by socio-economic classification of jobs [].

Income data is not a routinely collected statistic in the UK. Nevertheless, using a small survey of 7000 people on three measures of morbidity, @wilkinsonIncomeDistributionLife1992 showed health improved sharply from the lowest to the middle of the income range.

In 2015, the GBD Study released its first subational estimates of mortality, starting with the UK and Japan.
@steelChangesHealthCountries2018 assess these data, which divided the UK into 150 regions, finding mortality from all-causes varied twofold across the country, with the highest years of life lost in Blackpool and the lowest in Wokingham.
In a study on forecasting subnational life expectancy in England and Wales, @bennettFutureLifeExpectancy2015 estimated a 8.2 year range in life expectancy for men and 7.1 year range for women in 2012 between 375 districts.
The lowest life expectancies were seen in urban northern England, and the highest in the south and London's affluent districts.
Within London itself, male and female life expectancy showed 5-6 years of variation.

There have been substantial efforts in the UK to measure the deprivation of an area, with the standard deprivation indicator in England since the 2000s is the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) – a composite indicator for each Lower-layer Super Output Area (LSOA) covering income, unemployement, health, crime and environmental data sources [@EnglishIndicesDeprivation2019].
The Marmot Report presented life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy against IMD at the Middle-layer Super Output Area, whcih exhibit a strong social gradient [@marmotMarmotReviewFair2010].
The GBD study found the 15 most deprived UTLAs had consistently raised mortality, especially for all causes, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Deprived UTLAs in London, such as Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Barking and Dagenham did better than expected for that level of deprivation [@steelChangesHealthCountries2018].
@bennettContributionsDiseasesInjuries2018 jointly estimated death rates by age, year and deprivation decile.
They found since 2011, "the rise in female life expectancy has reversed in the two most deprived deciles, and has stalled in the third, fourth, and fifth most deprived deciles but has continued in better-off deciles."
The second Marmot Review in 2020 also found female life expectancy declined in the most deprived decile between the periods 2010-12 and 2016-18 [@marmotMarmotReview102020].
Digging further into these trends by region, the report found this trend was seen in all regions except London, the West Midlands and the North West, and that male life expectancy in the bottom decile also decreased in the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber and the East of England.

Since the turn of the millenium, there have been two periods of contrasting health policy in the UK.
The early 2000s saw the implementation of the English health inequalities strategy under New Labour, with explicit goals of reducing geographical inequalities in life expectancy.
The strategy saw a large increase in public spending targeting the social determinants of health, with policies on supporting families, tackling deprivation, and preventative healthcare.
@barrInvestigatingImpactEnglish2017 analysed the trends in life expectancy for different quantiles of deprivation and provided evidence that the strategy acheived its aim of reducing the gap in life expectancy between the 20% most-deprived areas and the rest of the English population.

Following the change in government in 2010, the strategy came to an end.
The Conservative government implemented a series of widespread cuts to public services, collectively known as austerity.
The study by @barrInvestigatingImpactEnglish2017 saw that the trends in inequality reduction were reversing since 2012.
These trends have been found at both ends of the life course: rising infant mortality associated with childhood poverty [@taylor-robinsonAssessingImpactRising2019], and falls in female life expectancy at 65 and 85 [@hiamWhyLifeExpectancy2018].
Although difficult to uncover causal relationships, @alexiouLocalGovernmentFunding2021 found strong associations between cuts to local government and the change in life expectancy of the district in the study period 2013-17.
As written in the _The New York Times_, "after eight years of budget cutting, Britain is looking less like the rest of Europe and more like the United States, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty" [@goodmanBritainAusterityChanging2018] – a comparison only compounded by the Brexit vote in 2018.

Policies of austerity were brought about as a response to the financial crash of 2008, which were global in scale, and many countries adopted similar fiscal strategies.
In an international study comparing mortality trends in England and Wales to 22 comparator countries @leonTrendsLifeExpectancy2019 show, however, that although there was a general slowdown in improvement of life expectancy across many nations, the slowdown in the most recent period of the study, 2011-16, was more pronounced in England and Wales.

After a decade of cuts, the UK entered the 2020s facing the greatest public health challenge for a generation: the Covid-19 pandemic.
Unsurprisingly, England and Wales suffering one of the highest excess deaths tolls relative to other industrialised countries [@kontisMagnitudeDemographicsDynamics2020].
At the current time of writing in 2023, the health service is yet to recover, with waiting lists for operations and waiting times for emergency care unhealthily high [@dorlingHowAusterityCaused2023].
There is no suggestion that the picture of health and health inequalities in the UK should improve in the coming years.
