## The Small Area Health Statistics Unit

In 1983, a documentary on the fallout produced from a fire at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria claimed that there was a ten-fold increase in cases of childhood leukaemia in the surrounding community.
This anomaly had gone undetected by public health authorities, raising concern that routinely collected data were not able to identify local clusters of disease.
The subsequent enquiry confirmed the excess, and recommended that a research unit was set up to monitor small area statistics and respond quickly to _ad hoc_ queries on local health hazards.
The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) was established in 1987 [@elliottSmallAreaHealth1992].

Beyond producing substantive research studies on environment and health, a core aim of SAHSU was to develop small area statistical methodology. In particular, methods of:

- _Disease mapping_. Summarising the spatial variation in risk.
- _Geographic correlation studies_. Is there a correlation between disease risk and environmental variables?
- _Point source type studies_, Is there an increased risk close to an environmental hazard?
- _Clustering_. Does a disease to produce non-random spatial patterns of incidence? If the aetiology is unknown, this could suggest the disease is infectious.

The focus for many of the studies were rare diseases at small areas, so there was a need for statistical smoothing, in particular Bayesian methods [@bestComparisonBayesianSpatial2005; @wakefieldIssuesStatisticalAnalysis1999; @elliottSpatialEpidemiologyMethods2001].

Elliot 1992. Pilot study was a point source. Collect deaths at postcode level. Docks near Plymouth. Dockyard workers, mesothelioma and asbestosis related to industrial exposure and asbestos. Circular bands drawn around Plymouth docks. Clear increase in risk within 3km of the docks.

Between 2001 and 2009 the Small Area Health Statistics Unit - SAHSU (based at Imperial College) published results from the most extensive study ever conducted into health effects of landfill sites. This work was initiated due to public concern over whether humans are exposed to toxic chemicals in landfill (which accounts for over 80% of municipal waste in Britain) and suffer adverse health consequences as a result [1-5]. The rates of birth defects, low birthweight, stillbirths, and of certain cancers in populations living within 2km of landfill sites were studied.

### Disease mapping

Best 2005 focuses on disease mapping. Discuss the method of each paper
