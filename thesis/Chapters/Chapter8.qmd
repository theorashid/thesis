## Public health and policy implications of findings

What is causing the epi transition backward that we saw at the MSOA level
Epi transition

## Future work

Bayesian methods
Highest resolution in a joint model, with error estimates

Substantive and methodological

Only care about LHS of equation.
Flexible models, such as Gaussian processes, which use inductive biases and knowledge, or wilder like 
Very familiar with research, was on a paper
But ultimately, the working environment was not conducive to methods development
Cluster offline, only a command line
This is health data â€“ Understand why people still use Scottish lip cancer and reference data
A lot of time spent scaling the models
Future research can incorporate new models
Joint likelihood for causes (e.g Best et al.), using multiple surface, or something more flexible like Kronecker GP
Packages don't exist yet, but should be there in near future

Since 2019, Covid
Produce a forecast of mortality
Run the counterfactual, as we did in Kontis at the weekly national level, but for district level and annual
See how the cause-composition changed
Obviously increase in infectious disease, but were injuries reduced?
Were cancer outcomes worse due to missed surgeries?
Is there a longer term effect due to strain on emergency services?
