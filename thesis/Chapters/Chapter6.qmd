# And what they died from: cause-specific mortality in England at the district level {#sec-Chapter6}

## Overview

## Methods

I performed a high-­resolution spatiotemporal analysis of civil registration data in which I extracted de­-identified data for all deaths in England from 2002 to 2019 (8,648,191 death records, extract date: 17<sup>th</sup> November 2022).
England was divided into 314 districts according to the boundaries in 2020.
Deaths were assigned into the following age groups: $0, 1–4, 5–9, ..., 80–84, 85+$ years.
I did not use 130 death records (<0.001%) for which sex was not recorded.
There were no age­-district-­year combinations in which the number of deaths from all causes exceeded population.

Each death record in the post-neonatal period was assigned an ICD-10 code corresponding to the underlying cause of death.
For neonates, which are not assigned an underlying cause of death, I used the ICD-10 code in the first position on the death record.
I used ICD-10 codes to assign each death to 136 cause groups of the WHO Global Health Estimates (GHE) study [@WHOMethodsData2020]; these groups encompass causes of death with related aetiology and clinical and public health relevance.
I also grouped diabetes mellitus and nephritis and nephrosis (hereafter referred to as _diabetes_) as these deaths might have a similar history.
I used the top 12 causes of death according to the total number of deaths from 2002 to 2019 for cause-specific analysis, as well as a residual groups comprising deaths from all other cancers, all other NCD, all other CVD, all other infections, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (IMPN), and injuries (external causes).
Together, these form a mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive list of causes of death.

The full list of ICD-10 codes for each cause group can be found in @tbl-ap-ch6-causes.

Although the size of the spatial unit of analysis has been increased to the district-level, by stratifying by cause of death, the number of death in each age-district-year-cause stratum is still very small.
As in @sec-Chapter4 and @sec-Chapter5, I used a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain stable estimates of death rates.
I conducted all analyses separately by sex and cause group.

I used a binomial likelihood:
$$
\text{deaths}_{ast} = \text{Binomial}(m_{ast}, \text{Population}_{ast}).
$$ {#eq-ch-6-likelihood}
A beta-binomial was trialled but did not improve model fit.
The model is as follows:
$$
\text{logit}({m_{ast}}) = \alpha_0 + \beta_0 t + \alpha_{1s} + \beta_{1s} t + \alpha_{2a} + \beta_{2a} t + \xi_{as} + \gamma_{at},
$$ {#eq-ch-6-model}
where the terms have the same meanings as @eq-ch-4-model.
This is the same as model @sec-Chapter5, but without a random walk for each spatial unit, which was tested but did not improve the fit despite adding a lot of complexity.

Spatial effects were modelled using a ICAR effect rather than the nested hierarchy of random effects seen in @sec-Chapter4 and @sec-Chapter5.
The geographies here only allow a two-tier hierarchy with only nine regions mapping to 314 districts, which was less preferable than a spatial model.
The ICAR model requires all spatial units to have neighbours.
Thus, the districts containing the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly were each joined to the nearest mainland district based on road or ferry connections.

All model parameters, their priors and dimensions are in @tbl-ap-ch6-model.

I fitted the model in the probabilistic programming language NumPyro [@phanComposableEffectsFlexible2019] and obtained 1,000 draws from the posterior distribution of model parameters that were used to calculate age-specific death rates.
Where possible, non-centred parametrisations were used in the model to improve the efficiency of the NUTS samplers.
I ran four chains with a warmup of 2000 iterations and then 10,000 further iterations and thinned the remainder by 40 to obtain 1000 post-burn-in draws from the posterior distribution of model parameters.

I ran a model for a combined group of all deaths to calculate life expectancy in each district.
Death rates for this total mortality group, and for injuries, were corrected in 2017 in Kensington and Chelsea for the Grenfell fire by imputing using the mean deaths from injuries between 2016 and 2018 before running the model.

The primary reporting outcome is the unconditional probability of dying between birth and 80 years of age.
Unconditional probability is the probability of death in the absence of competing causes of death, and is calculated using life table methods from age-specific death rates from the cause of interest.
I limited the age range to 80 years because the probability of death in the absence of competing causes equals 100% when the entire life course is considered.
The reported 95% credible intervals represent the 2.5<sup>th</sup> and 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the posterior distribution of estimated probability of death.

I calculated the contributions of deaths from each cause of death, in each age group, to the life expectancy change for each district between different time periods using Arriaga's method, which is widely used to decompose life expectancy differences between populations or population subgroups [@arriagaMeasuringExplainingChange1984].
Arriaga's method calculates how much each age group contributes to the life expectancy difference by summing how much death rate differences at that age change the years of life lived both at that age and in subsequent ages through changing the number of survivors.
It then partitions the age-specific contributions to the life expectancy gap by cause of death in proportion to the difference in cause-specific death rates between the subgroups.
The cause-specific death rates were scaled such that the sum over all causes was equal to the estimate for total mortality.
For this analysis, I used the sample mean death rate in each age-district-year-cause combination.

Details on the calculations for both the probability of dying and Arriaga's method can be found in @sec-appA.

## Results

### All causes

There were 4,465,948 (48.4%) deaths in women and 4,182,108 (51.6%) in men in England from 2002 to 2019.
3,972,286 (45.9%) of these deaths occurred in people aged younger than 80 years of age.
@fig-ch-6-treemap shows the leading causes of death for each sex.

In the following sections, I will write in turn on each of the wider cause groups (CVDs; NCDs; cancers; maternal, perinatal, nutritional and infectious causes; injuries) in order of largest proportion of total deaths.

### Cardiovascular diseases

Although mortality from CVD has more than halved since the 1980s in England, it remained the wider cause group with the largest proportion of deaths at 2,712,895 (31.4%).
The highest probability of dying in 2019 for any sex-cause-district combination was for ischaemic heart disease in Manchester at 0.13 (0.12-0.13) (@fig-ch-6-map-ihd).

@asariaTrendsInequalitiesCardiovascular2012 found CVD mortality followed a persistent downward trend in nearly all wards in England from 1982 to 2006.
Both ischaemic heart disease (@fig-ch-6-map-ihd) and stroke mortality (@fig-ch-6-map-stroke) have continued to follow this trend through to 2019 at the district level.
These reflect improvements in reducing and controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, organisational changes to the NHS such that acute CVD episodes are treated in specific centres, improvements in the treatment of CVD including coronary angiographies and stent insertion, and public health campaigns such as FAST (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, Time) so the general public know when to seek emergency help.

All other CVD also shows a downward trend, with the exceptions of Hastings and, more noticeably, the Isle of Wight.
Looking at the raw data for these districts, there is a step increase the use of ICD-10 code I51.5 – a garbage CVD code [@murrayGlobalBurdenDisease1996] – since around 2012, suggesting these trends result from poor coding practice.

### Non-communicable diseases

Non-communicable diseases were responsible for 2,508,844 (29.0%) deaths from 2002 to 2019 (@fig-ch-6-treemap).

Probability of dying from Alzheimer's and other dementias between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.
:::

Alzheimer's and other dementias saw the largest increases of any cause, with all districts observing an increase for both sexes (@fig-ch-6-map-alzheimer).
It was also one of the most unequal causes of death, with a 4.1- and 3.6-fold difference for women and men between the highest and lowest districts in 2019.
This reflects that, beyond age and family history, the main risk factors for Alzheimer's and other dementias are the same as for CVD (smoking, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol).

Some part of this trend may be due to increased diagnosis and coding of deaths as dementias, with doctors increasingly assigning mental and neurological conditions as the underlying cause of death rather than simply "dying of old age".
It is worth noting that given only 96,109 (14.5% of 663,692) of deaths from Alzheimer's and other dementias occur in those under 80 years, the probability of dying between birth and 80 is probably not the best metric for summarising this particular disease.

:::

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was had the largest geographical variation of any disease for women, with a 6.0-fold variation (4.4-fold for men).
The probability of dying declined in a larger proportion of districts for men (305 (97.1%)) than for women (215 (68.5%)).
This is a result of the main risk factor, tobacco smoking, peaking later in women than in men.
The largest increases for both sexes were seen in Kingston upon Hull for (45.9% (24.8% to 67.9%) for women and 20.6% (2.9% to 40.7%) for men).

:::

Mortality from diabetes decreased in every district for both sexes (@fig-ch-6-map-diabetes), matching trends at the national level in the literature [@pearson-stuttardTrendsPredominantCauses2021].
Those who are African-Caribbean, Black African, Chinese or South Asian are more at risk, and the highest probabilities of dying for each sex were in east London – one of the most ethnically diverse areas in the country.
Specifically, the borough of Newham had the highest mortality for both sexes (0.01 (0.01-0.01) for women and 0.02 (0.01-0.02) for men).

![Probability of dying for men from liver cirrhosis between birth and 80 years of age in 314 local authority districts in England in 2019 and change from 2002 to 2019.](../thesis-analysis/thesis_analysis/causes/figures/male_map_Cirrhosis_of_the_liver.pdf){#fig-ch-6-map-liver-cirrhosis-men}

Liver cirrhosis, an advanced stage of liver damage, was only of the top 12 leading causes of death for men (67,116 (1.6%)) but not for women.
It has perhaps the most interesting geography for change of all causes, with contrast between huge decreases in London and increases in the rest of the country, with the largest in the coastal southwest and east.
The geography is perhaps indicative of the contrasting dynamics of the two main risk factors for liver cirrhosis: alcohol misuse and hepatitis B/C infection.
Alcohol is the main cause of liver disease, and has driven a large proportion of increases in liver cirrhosis throughout Europe [@blachierBurdenLiverDisease2013].
Alcohol is generally consumed less in the capital, with London having the lowest percentage of adults who abstain from drinking alcohol (23.6%) and the lowest percentage of adults who drink over 14 units per week (20.1%) [@LocalAlcoholProfiles2021].
On the other hand, prevalence of hepatitis B/C has decreased over the past decades.
There has been reduced incidence and vaccination for hepatitis B.
Since a large number of people acquired hepatitis C in the 1970s and 1980s, the virus was identified and transmission has reduced [@blachierBurdenLiverDisease2013].

All other NCDs had the highest mortality for any disease for women, with the highest probability of dying of 0.09 (0.08-0.09) in Blackpool (@fig-ch-6-map-other-ncd).

:::

### Cancers

Cancers accounted for 28.5% of all deaths, nearly the same total mortality burden as NCDs.
With over 150 different types of cancer, each with their own anatomical and molecular subtypes, cancer is extremely complex, with a specialist workforce dedicated to each unique cancer.
Compared with CVDs and NCDs, which are dominated by their major causes (ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and Alzheimer's, COPD and diabetes, respectively), cancers have the largest number of individual causes in the top 12.
I felt I should go deeper into the cancer story, and pay further attention to a wider variety of site-specific cancers.
This is the focus of @sec-Chapter7.

### Maternal, perinatal, nutritional and infectious causes

As is the case in most high income countries, which are in the third stage of the epidemiologic transition, there are far fewer deaths (666,783 (7.7%)) from maternal, perinatal, nutritional and infectious causes compared to the NCDs of group 2 (including CVD and cancers).
Although notably, these results consider the period before the Covid-19 pandemic, so the cause-composition will have changed to include more deaths from infections over the most recent years.

Mortality from lower respiratory infections, which include influenza and pneumonia, can vary greatly between years depending on the severity of the virus and whether the flu vaccination prevents the prevalent strain.
It also depends on the strength of the immune system of the infected.
The ability of the lungs to recover from infection can be degraded by years of industrial exposure or smoking, which perhaps influences the high mortality in the urban northwest (@fig-ch-6-map-respiratory).

The similar profiles for men and women for the level of mortality from all other IMPN in 2019 (@fig-ch-6-map-other-IMPN) reflects that the three main causes by number of deaths are other infectious diseases, diarrhoeal diseases, low birth weight rather than maternal conditions.
However, the change in probability of dying was greatly different between the sexes, with 71 (22.6%) districts seeing an increase for women, the largest in Barrow-in-Furness (55.6% (-0.8% to 135.2%)), compared to only 5 (0.02%) districts for men.
Without further disaggregating this group, it is difficult to suggest drivers of these trends.

### Injuries

Accounting for only 295,034 (3.4%) of total deaths from 2002 to 2019, injuries contribute the smallest proportion of the wider groups of causes of death.
The highest mortality in 2019 were in coastal areas, where there are obvious natural hazards, are in the urban northwest (@fig-ch-6-map-injuries).
Blackpool had the highest probability of dying for men at 0.04 (0.04-0.05), which corresponds with the literature on rates of mortality from drugs and suicide [@congdonGeographicalPatternsDrugRelated2019].

### Contribution to life expectancy change

From 2002 to 2019, every district increased in life expectancy for both women and men (@fig-ch-6-contribution).
This was driven largely by decreases in ischaemic heart disease, which contributed gains of between 0.7 and 1.9 years for women between 1.4 and 4.0 years for men.
In contrast, Alzheimer's and other dementias acted in the other direction, forcing life expectancy gains downwards by between 0.2 and 1.1 years for women and between 0.4 and 1.0 years for women.

:::

In @fig-ch-6-contribution-split, I break the overall trend down into two time periods around the year 2010.
This both follows the analysis for @fig-ch-4-change, but also it is the year there was a change in government, and a change in fiscal policy towards austerity.

In the period 2010-19, life expectancy progress slowed in England, as dicussed at the MSOA level in @sec-Chapter4, with three districts experiencing a decline in life expectancy.
For women, lung cancer switched from generally contributing negatively to the change in district life expectancy (@fig-ch-6-contribution-women-2002-2010) to positively (@fig-ch-6-contribution-women-2010-2019)
The contribution for the other cancer groups was similar for the two time periods.
There were a larger number of districts with positive contributions for all other NCDs in the second period.
The positive contribution from all the CVD groups (ischaemic heart disease, stroke, all other CVD) was weaker for the second time period as the negative forcing effect of Alzheimer's and other dementias strengthed massively.
In the years 2010 to 2019, the _inequality_ in progress between districts was driven largely by Alzheimer's and all other NCD, both with a difference in contribution between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile districts of 3.0 years.

For men, the contribution for all cancers groups, including lung cancer, maintained the same picture in each time period.
As for women, the slowdown in progress was driven by reductions in the contribution from CVDs in the second time period and the strong negative contributions from Alzheimer's and other dementias.
Reductions in CVD slowing on average – not uniform. Still increasing in lowest districts
Injuries, which contributed positively to life expectancy increases in 2002-10 for all districts, saw a reversal with all but 19 districts contributing negatively.
In the latter period, ischaemic heart disease, Alzheimer's and other dementias, and all other NCD were driving the inequality in progress between districts, with differences in contribution between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile districts of 2.8, 2.9 and 3.0 years respectively.

## Discussion

This analysis revealed huge inequalities in mortality for a wide-ranging variety of causes of death in England.
In particular, although there were widespread declines in CVDs, there have been huge increases in Alzheimer's and other dementias, which in 2019 became one of the most unequal causes of death, with a 4.1- and 3.6-fold difference for women and men between the highest and lowest districts.
I found that the slowdown in life expectancy gain since around 2010 has been driven largely by Alzheimer's and other dementias and all other NCD in women, and by ischaemic heart disease, Alzheimer's and other dementias, and all other NCD in men.

### Strengths and limitations

The work presents trends in cause-specific mortality over a period of substantial policy interest at the district level, and uncovers which causes of death have been driving the slowdown in progress since 2010.

The study was carried out at the district level rather than MSOA level, which masks substantial heterogeneity and was the motivation for the all-cause mortality study in @sec-Chapter4.
However, when stratifying further by cause of death, the number of deaths in each age-space-time-cause stratum can be extremely small, even at the district level, which makes the estimation task difficult.
Furthermore, running a model that takes a day of GPU time to reach convergence for all causes at the MSOA level for 34 cause-sex combinations is extremely computationally demanding.

This study did not look at age- and cause-specific contributions to life expectancy inequality, unlike @bennettContributionsDiseasesInjuries2018, and instead collapsed over age groups.
Although this masks some variation, the groups were selected based on the total number of deaths from 2002 to 2019, and are therefore skewed towards older ages, and the age-specific contributions of (e.g.) dementias is not particularly interesting.

There is always the desire the split the residual groups into more and more causes of death.
For example, there are interesting patterns in the change of all other IMPN (@fig-ch-6-map-other-IMPN-women), and it would be interesting to understand further how the component causes of all other NCD are driving the inequality in progress (@fig-ch-6-contribution-split).
Moreover, there has been a lot of recent attention in the literature on "deaths of despair" – deaths from drug overdose, suicide or alcoholic liver disease – in the UK [@angusIncreasesDeathsDespair2023] and the US [@caseRisingMorbidityMortality2015], and it would of interest to separate injuries into intentional and unintentional.
However, the groupings were chosen based on the rule to prevent the number of deaths in each cause from becoming too small.

It would have been desirable, albeit computationally challenging, to run all cause groups in a single joint model.
When calculating contributions using Arriaga's method, mortality for each cause group was scaled such that the sum across all causes equalled to the estimate for total mortality.
This would not be necessary if cause-specific mortality were estimated in the same model as the causes of death would adjust amongst each other each iteration to sum to total mortality.
@foremanSmallAreaForecasts2017 jointly forecasted cause-specific death rates for states in the US, but instead estimated each age group separately.

Unlike @sec-Chapter4 and @sec-Chapter5, migration not as much of an issue at the district level.
As @vandijkUsingLinkedConsumer2021 explain, "the majority of moves occur over short distances: the 2011 Census records that 57.1% of the individuals aged 16 and over that changed address within the preceding 12 months moved within the same... district."

### Comparison with previous literature

There are two key studies in the literature which break the population of England down into subgroups and look at the cause-composition of mortality: Firstly, from my research group, @bennettContributionsDiseasesInjuries2018 divide the population by deciles of deprivation and look at largely similar groups of causes as in this chapter.
The authors found the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived areas was caused by the large contributions of respiratory diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and a set of preventable and treatable cancers.
Unlike the present work, the authors broke down further by age, finding that deaths in children younger than 5 years and dementias in older ages drove the inequality between the top and bottom deciles.

Secondly, as one of the first GBD studies of subnational populations, @steelChangesHealthCountries2018 looked at trends in mortality of 150 upper tier local authorities, which are larger than the districts used in this chapter, but looked at a massive 264 causes of deaths, relying heavily on covariates in the model to produce estimates for areas with little to no data on more obscure causes.
As with @bennettContributionsDiseasesInjuries2018 and the work here, the GBD group found the rate of improvement in life expectancy had slowed since 2010.
They found, in general, the slowdown was driven by the disappearance of sustained annual improvements from ischaemic heart disease, strokes, as in @fig-ch-6-contribution-split, but also to a lesser extent from colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer.
The authors found the annual reduction in mortality attributable to most major risk factors (tobacco, dietary risks, high blood pressure etc) had declined since 1990, but has slowed since 2010, with the exception of alcohol and drug use, which has seen little change since the 2000s.

Both these studies focus on what causes of death have driven the inequality between subgroups of the population.
The work in this chapter focuses instead on what causes of death have driven the the _inequality in progress_ between subgroups of the population.
