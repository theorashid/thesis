  abstract = {Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted mental health, health-related behaviours such as drinking and illicit drug use and the accessibility of health and social care services. How these pandemic shocks affected `despair'-related mortality in different countries is less clear. This study uses public data to compare deaths from alcohol, drugs and suicide in the United States and the United Kingdom to identify similarities or differences in the impact of the pandemic on important non-COVID causes of death across countries and to consider the public health implications of these trends. Study design and methods Data were taken from publicly available mortality figures for England and Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland and the United States of America, 2001\textendash 2021, and analysed descriptively through age-standardised and age-specific mortality rates from suicide, alcohol and drug use. Results Alcohol-specific deaths increased in all countries between 2019 and 2021, most notably in the United States and, to a lesser extent, England and Wales. Suicide rates did not increase markedly during the pandemic in any of the included nations. Drug-related mortality rates rose dramatically over the same period in the United States but not in other nations. Conclusions Mortality from `deaths of despair' during the pandemic has displayed divergent trends between causes and countries. Concerns about increases in deaths by suicide appear to have been unfounded, whereas deaths due to alcohol have risen across the United Kingdom and in the United States and across almost all age groups. Scotland and the United States had similarly high levels of drug-related deaths pre-pandemic, but the differing trends during the pandemic highlight the different underlying causes of these drug death epidemics and the importance of tailoring policy responses to these specific contexts.},

  abstract = {Background We identify socioeconomic disparities by region in cancer morbidity and mortality in England for all-cancer and type-specific cancers, and use incidence data to quantify the impact of cancer diagnosis delays on cancer deaths between 2001\textendash 2016. Methods and findings We obtain population cancer morbidity and mortality rates at various age, year, gender, deprivation, and region levels based on a Bayesian approach. A significant increase in type-specific cancer deaths, which can also vary among regions, is shown as a result of delay in cancer diagnoses. Our analysis suggests increase of 7.75\% (7.42\% to 8.25\%) in female lung cancer mortality in London, as an impact of 12-month delay in cancer diagnosis, and a 3.39\% (3.29\% to 3.48\%) increase in male lung cancer mortality across all regions. The same delay can cause a 23.56\% (23.09\% to 24.30\%) increase in male bowel cancer mortality. Furthermore, for all-cancer mortality, the highest increase in deprivation gap happened in the East Midlands, from 199 (186 to 212) in 2001, to 239 (224 to 252) in 2016 for males, and from 114 (107 to 121) to 163 (155 to 171) for females. Also, for female lung cancer, the deprivation gap has widened with the highest change in the North West, e.g. for incidence from 180 (172 to 188) to 272 (261 to 282), whereas it has narrowed for prostate cancer incidence with the biggest reduction in the South West from 165 (139 to 190) in 2001 to 95 (72 to 117) in 2016. Conclusions The analysis reveals considerable disparities in all-cancer and some type-specific cancers with respect to socioeconomic status. Furthermore, a significant increase in cancer deaths is shown as a result of delays in cancer diagnoses which can be linked to concerns about the effect of delay in cancer screening and diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health interventions at regional and deprivation level can contribute to prevention of cancer deaths.},

We estimated CVD mortality by ward in 5-year intervals between 1982 and 2006, and examined trends in relation to starting mortality, region and community deprivation.Methods We analysed CVD death rates using a Bayesian spatial technique for all 7932 English electoral wards in consecutive 5-year intervals between 1982 and 2006, separately for men and women aged 30\textendash 64 years and {$\geq$}65 years.Results Age-standardized CVD mortality declined in the majority of wards, but increased in 186 wards for women aged {$\geq$}65 years. The decline was larger where starting mortality had been higher. When grouped by deprivation quintile, absolute inequality between most- and least-deprived wards narrowed over time in those aged 30\textendash 64 years, but increased in older adults; relative inequalities worsened in all four age\textendash sex groups. Wards with high CVD mortality in 2002\textendash 06 fell into two groups: those in and around large metropolitan cities in northern England that started with high mortality in 1982\textendash 86 and could not `catch up', despite impressive declines, and those that started with average or low mortality in the 1980s but `fell behind' because of small mortality reductions.Conclusions Improving population health and reducing health inequalities should be treated as related policy and measurement goals.

The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) has developed a Rapid Inquiry Facility, which will produce an estimated relative risk for any given condition for the population within defined areas around a point source, relative to the population in a local reference region. The system can also facilitate the production of annual reports and other health studies for Departments of Public Health Medicine through the creation of ward-level maps to illustrate disease variation across small areas.Methods The facility uses routinely collected morbidity, mortality and population data at a small area scale, together with the computing facilities and expertise necessary to run such analyses quickly and efficiently. Using this facility SAHSU can supply a report within three working days. To aid interpretation, smoothed small area maps that account for sampling variability in the observed data can also be produced.Results The paper reports on two case studies where the pilot system has been utilized by health authorities for both point source analyses and small area disease mapping.Conclusions We believe that this facility would be of considerable use to districts. The local knowledge and expertise of the local public health specialist is essential in the interpretation and presentation of the facility's output.

METHODS: We obtained population and death data between 2016 and 2018 from the National Health Information Database and constructed abridged life tables using standard life table procedures according to sex and income quintiles for the electoral constituencies of the 20th National Assembly election held in 2016. RESULTS: Life expectancy across the 253 constituencies ranged from 80.51 to 87.05 years, corresponding to a gap of 6.54 years. The life expectancy difference by income across the 253 constituencies ranged from 2.94 years to 10.67 years. In each province, the difference in life expectancy by income across electoral constituencies was generally greater than the inter-constituency differences. Constituencies in capital and metropolitan areas showed a higher life expectancy and a lower life expectancy difference by income than constituencies in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-rich inequalities in life expectancy by income existed in every electoral constituency in Korea. Both intra-constituency and inter-constituency socioeconomic inequalities in health should be highlighted in future policy-making in the National Assembly.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate whether the English health inequalities strategy was associated with a decline in geographical health inequalities, compared with trends before and after the strategy. Design Time trend analysis. Setting Two groups of lower tier local authorities in England. The most deprived, bottom fifth and the rest of England. Intervention The English health inequalities strategy\textemdash a cross government strategy implemented between 1997 and 2010 to reduce health inequalities in England. Trends in geographical health inequalities were assessed before (1983-2003), during (2004-12), and after (2013-15) the strategy using segmented linear regression. Main outcome measure Geographical health inequalities measured as the relative and absolute differences in male and female life expectancy at birth between the most deprived local authorities in England and the rest of the country. Results Before the strategy the gap in male and female life expectancy between the most deprived local authorities in England and the rest of the country increased at a rate of 0.57 months each year (95\% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.74 months) and 0.30 months each year (0.12 to 0.48 months). During the strategy period this trend reversed and the gap in life expectancy for men reduced by 0.91 months each year (0.54 to 1.27 months) and for women by 0.50 months each year (0.15 to 0.86 months). Since the end of the strategy period the inequality gap has increased again at a rate of 0.68 months each year (-0.20 to 1.56 months) for men and 0.31 months each year (-0.26 to 0.88) for women. By 2012 the gap in male life expectancy was 1.2 years smaller (95\% confidence interval 0.8 to 1.5 years smaller) and the gap in female life expectancy was 0.6 years smaller (0.3 to 1.0 years smaller) than it would have been if the trends in inequalities before the strategy had continued. Conclusion The English health inequalities strategy was associated with a decline in geographical inequalities in life expectancy, reversing a previously increasing trend. Since the strategy ended, inequalities have started to increase again. The strategy may have reduced geographical health inequalities in life expectancy, and future approaches should learn from this experience. The concerns are that current policies are reversing the achievements of the strategy.},

Heart disease is the main condition associated with increased excess male mortality for those born after 1900. We further show that smoking-attributable deaths account for about 30\% of excess male mortality at ages 50\textendash 70 for cohorts born in 1900\textendash 1935. However, after accounting for smoking, substantial excess male mortality at ages 50\textendash 70 remained, particularly from cardiovascular disease. The greater male vulnerability to cardiovascular conditions emerged with the reduction in infectious mortality and changes in health-related behaviors.},

Perhaps the most straightforward task is that of image restoration, though it is often suggested that this is an area of relatively minor practical importance. The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images. Two examples are given, one in archeology, the other in epidemiology. These are preceded by a partial review of pixel-based Bayesian image analysis.},

  abstract = {With the advent of routine health data indexed at a fine geographical resolution, small area disease mapping studies have become an established technique in geographical epidemiology. The specific issues posed by the sparseness of the data and possibility for local spatial dependence belong to a generic class of statistical problems involving an underlying (latent) spatial process of interest corrupted by observational noise. These are naturally formulated within the framework of hierarchical models, and over the past decade, a variety of spatial models have been proposed for the latent level(s) of the hierarchy. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the main classes of such models that have been used for disease mapping within a Bayesian estimation paradigm, and report a performance comparison between representative models in these classes, using a set of simulated data to help illustrate their respective properties. We also consider recent extensions to model the joint spatial distribution of multiple disease or health indicators. The aim is to help the reader choose an appropriate structural prior for the second level of the hierarchical model and to discuss issues of sensitivity to this choice.},

The incidence and prevalence of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer are key to understand the burden of liver disease. They represent the end-stage of liver pathology and thus are indicative of the associated mortality. About 0.1\% of Hungarian males will die of cirrhosis every year compared with 0.001\% of Greek females. WHO estimate that liver cancer is responsible for around 47,000 deaths per year in the EU. Harmful alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis B and C and metabolic syndromes related to overweight and obesity are the leading causes of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer in Europe. Chronic hepatitis B affects 0.5\textendash 0.7\% of the European population. In the last decade the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C was 0.13\textendash 3.26\%. It is of great concern that about 90\% of people in Europe infected by viral hepatitis are unaware of their status. Available data suggest the prevalence rate of NAFLD is 2\textendash 44\% in the general European population (including obese children) and 42.6\textendash 69.5\% in people with type 2 diabetes. Each of these four major causes of liver disease is amenable to prevention and treatment, reducing the burden of liver disease in Europe and saving lives. Further surveys are urgently needed to implement cost-effective prevention programmes and novel treatments to tackle this problem.},

We find that the deep underlying inequalities and policy challenges that we already had are crucial in understanding the complex impacts of the pandemic itself and our response to it, and that the crisis does in itself have the potential to exacerbate some of these pre-existing inequalities fairly directly. Moreover, it seems likely that the current crisis will leave legacies that will impact inequalities in the long term. These possibilities are not all disequalising, but many are.},

  abstract = {The relationship between income and life expectancy is well established but remains poorly understood.To measure the level, time trend, and geographic variability in the association between income and life expectancy and to identify factors related to small area variation.Income data for the US population were obtained from 1.4 billion deidentified tax records between 1999 and 2014. Mortality data were obtained from Social Security Administration death records. These data were used to estimate race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy at 40 years of age by household income percentile, sex, and geographic area, and to evaluate factors associated with differences in life expectancy.Pretax household earnings as a measure of income.Relationship between income and life expectancy; trends in life expectancy by income group; geographic variation in life expectancy levels and trends by income group; and factors associated with differences in life expectancy across areas.The sample consisted of 1\,408\,287\,218 person-year observations for individuals aged 40 to 76 years (mean age, 53.0 years; median household earnings among working individuals, \$61\,175 per year). There were 4\,114\,380 deaths among men (mortality rate, 596.3 per 100\,000) and 2\,694\,808 deaths among women (mortality rate, 375.1 per 100\,000). The analysis yielded 4 results. First, higher income was associated with greater longevity throughout the income distribution. The gap in life expectancy between the richest 1\% and poorest 1\% of individuals was 14.6 years (95\% CI, 14.4 to 14.8 years) for men and 10.1 years (95\% CI, 9.9 to 10.3 years) for women. Second, inequality in life expectancy increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy increased by 2.34 years for men and 2.91 years for women in the top 5\% of the income distribution, but by only 0.32 years for men and 0.04 years for women in the bottom 5\% (P\,\&lt;\,.001 for the differences for both sexes). Third, life expectancy for low-income individuals varied substantially across local areas. In the bottom income quartile, life expectancy differed by approximately 4.5 years between areas with the highest and lowest longevity. Changes in life expectancy between 2001 and 2014 ranged from gains of more than 4 years to losses of more than 2 years across areas. Fourth, geographic differences in life expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile were significantly correlated with health behaviors such as smoking (r\,=\,-0.69, P\,\&lt;\,.001), but were not significantly correlated with access to medical care, physical environmental factors, income inequality, or labor market conditions. Life expectancy for low-income individuals was positively correlated with the local area fraction of immigrants (r\,=\,0.72, P\,\&lt;\,.001), fraction of college graduates (r\,=\,0.42, P\,\&lt;\,.001), and government expenditures (r\,=\,0.57, P\,\&lt;\,.001).In the United States between 2001 and 2014, higher income was associated with greater longevity, and differences in life expectancy across income groups increased over time. However, the association between life expectancy and income varied substantially across areas; differences in longevity across income groups decreased in some areas and increased in others. The differences in life expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and local area characteristics.},

Additionally, the implicit model underlying conventional life table analysis involves a highly parametrized fixed effect approach. An alternative strategy proposed here involves an explicit model based on random effects for both small areas and age groups. The area effects are assumed to be spatially correlated, reflecting unknown mortality risk factors that are themselves typically spatially correlated. Often mortality observations are disaggregated by demographic category as well as by age and area, e.g. by gender or ethnic group, and multivariate area and age random effects will be used to pool over such groups. A case study considers variations in life expectancy in 1 118 small areas (known as wards) in Eastern England over a five-year period 1999\textendash 2003. The case study deaths data are classified by gender, age, and area, and a bivariate model for area and age effects is therefore applied. The interrelationship between the random area effects and two major influences on small area life expectancy is demonstrated in the study, these being area socio-economic status (or deprivation) and the location of nursing and residential homes for frail elderly.},

  abstract = {Existing analyses of trends in disability free life expectancy (DFLE) are mainly at aggregate level (national or broad regional). However, major differences in DFLE, and trends in these expectancies, exist between different neighbourhoods within regions, so supporting a small area perspective. However, this raises issues regarding the stability of conventional life table estimation methods at small area scales. This paper advocates a Bayesian borrowing strength technique to model trends in mortality and disability differences across 625 small areas in London, using illness data from the 2001 and 2011 population Censuses, and deaths data for two periods centred on the Census years. From this analysis, estimates of total life expectancy and DFLE are obtained. The spatio-temporal modelling perspective allows assessment of whether significant compression or expansion of morbidity has occurred in each small area. Appropriate models involve random effects that recognise correlation and interaction effects over relevant dimensions of the observed deaths and illness data (areas, ages), as well as major spatial trends (e.g. gradients in health and mortality according to area deprivation category). Whilst borrowing strength is a primary consideration (and demonstrated by raised precision for estimated life expectancies), so also is model parsimony. Therefore, pure borrowing strength models are compared with models allowing selection of random age-area interaction effects using a spike-slab prior, and in fact borrowing strength combined with random effects selection provides better fit.

Modelling questions include choice between random walk priors for age and time effects as against non-linear regression functions, questions of identifiability when several random effects are present in the death rates model, and the choice of model when both within and out-of-sample performance may be important. A case study application involves 44 small areas in North East London and mortality in five sub-periods (1986-88, 1989-91, 1992-94, 1995-97, 1998-2000) between 1986 and 2000, with the final period used for assessing out-of-sample performance.},

However, this methodology may be flawed as it ignores population movement, which previous research has shown to be selective, with a net loss of the more affluent (and possibly healthier) residents from deprived to more affluent areas. This paper investigates whether selective migration contributed sufficiently to the observed socio-economic gradients in mortality in England and Wales throughout the 1990s so as to invalidate the current method of monitoring health inequalities. The ONS Longitudinal Study for England and Wales was used to calculate directly standardised mortality rates (DSR) by decile of deprivation in 1991 and 2001. The DSRs for 2001 were calculated twice, once according to decile of residence in 2001, and also according to the original decile in 1991. Selective migration was found to make an important contribution in explaining increases in inequalities between areas, accounting for about 50\% of the increase for those aged less than 75. At the older age groups, however, selective migration was responsible for a narrowing of mortality differentials over time. These results indicate that caution should be exercised when using repeated ecological studies in assessing the extent of changes in inequalities over time.},

  abstract = {We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects.

  abstract = {Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic disparities over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity.To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.Annual county-level life tables were constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.County of residence.Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk.Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95\% UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60\%, 74\%, and 27\% of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74\% of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors.Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States.},

  abstract = {Study objective: To evaluate methods for calculating life expectancy in small areas, for example, English electoral wards. Design: The Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the distribution of life expectancy (and its standard error) estimates for 10 alternative life table models. The models were combinations of Chiang or Silcocks methodology, 5 or 10 year age intervals, and a final age interval of 85+, 90+, or 95+. Setting: A hypothetical small area experiencing the population age structure and age specific mortality rates of English men 1998\textendash 2000. Participants: Routine mortality and population statistics for England. Main results: Silcocks and Chiang based models gave similar estimates of life expectancy and its standard error. For all models, life expectancy was increasingly overestimated as the simulated population size decreased. The degree of overestimation depended largely on the final age interval chosen. Life expectancy estimates of small populations are normally distributed. The standard error estimates are normally distributed for large populations but become increasingly skewed as the population size decreases. Substitution methods to compensate for the effect of zero death counts on the standard error estimate did not improve the estimate. Conclusions: It is recommended that a population years at risk of 5000 is a reasonable point above which life expectancy calculations can be performed with reasonable confidence. Implications are discussed. Within the UK, the Chiang methodology and a five year life table to 85+ is recommended, with no adjustments to age specific death counts of zero.},

Design: Geographical study of risks of adverse birth outcomes in populations living within 2 km of 9565 landfill sites operational at some time between 1982 and 1997 (from a total of 19 196 sites) compared with those living further away. Setting: Great Britain. Subjects: Over 8.2 million live births, 43 471 stillbirths, and 124 597 congenital anomalies (including terminations). Main outcome measures: All congenital anomalies combined, some specific anomalies, and prevalence of low and very low birth weight ({$<$}2500 g and {$<$}1500 g). Results: For all anomalies combined, relative risk of residence near landfill sites (all waste types) was 0.92 (99\% confidence interval 0.907 to 0.923) unadjusted, and 1.01 (1.005 to 1.023) adjusted for confounders. Adjusted risks were 1.05 (1.01 to 1.10) for neural tube defects, 0.96 (0.93 to 0.99) for cardiovascular defects, 1.07 (1.04 to 1.10) for hypospadias and epispadias (with no excess of surgical correction), 1.08 (1.01 to 1.15) for abdominal wall defects, 1.19 (1.05 to 1.34) for surgical correction of gastroschisis and exomphalos, and 1.05 (1.047 to 1.055) and 1.04 (1.03 to 1.05) for low and very low birth weight respectively. There was no excess risk of stillbirth. Findings for special (hazardous) waste sites did not differ systematically from those for non-special sites. For some specific anomalies, higher risks were found in the period before opening compared with after opening of a landfill site, especially hospital admissions for abdominal wall defects. Conclusions: We found small excess risks of congenital anomalies and low and very low birth weight in populations living near landfill sites. No causal mechanisms are available to explain these findings, and alternative explanations include data artefacts and residual confounding. Further studies are needed to help differentiate between the various possibilities. What is already known on this topic What is already known on this topic Various studies have found excess risks of certain congenital anomalies and low birth weight near landfill sites Risks up to two to three times higher have been reported These studies have been difficult to interpret because of problems of exposure classification, small sample size, confounding, and reporting bias What this study adds What this study adds Some 80\% of the British population lives within 2 km of known landfill sites in Great Britain By including all landfill sites in the country, we avoided the problem of selective reporting, and maximised statistical power Although we found excess risks of congenital anomalies and low birth weight near landfill sites in Great Britain, they were smaller than in some other studies Further work is needed to differentiate potential data artefacts and confounding effects from possible causal associations with landfill},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE--The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) was established at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in response to a recommendation of the enquiry into the increased incidence of childhood leukaemia near Sellafield, the nuclear reprocessing plant in West Cumbria. The aim of this paper was to describe the Unit's methods for the investigation of health around point sources of environmental pollution in the United Kingdom. DESIGN--Routine data currently including deaths and cancer registrations are held in a large national database which uses a post code based retrieval system to locate cases geographically and link them to the underlying census enumeration districts, and hence to their populations at risk. Main outcome measures were comparison of observed/expected ratios (based on national rates) within bands delineated by concentric circles around point sources of environmental pollution located anywhere in Britain. MAIN RESULTS--The system is illustrated by a study of mortality from mesothelioma and asbestosis near the Plymouth naval dockyards during 1981-87. Within a 3 km radius of the docks the mortality rate for mesothelioma was higher than the national rate by a factor of 8.4, and that for asbestosis was higher by a factor of 13.6. CONCLUSIONS--SAHSU is a new national facility which is rapidly able to provide rates of mortality and cancer incidence for arbitrary circles drawn around any point in Britain. The example around Plymouth of mesothelioma and asbestosis demonstrates the ability of the system to detect an unusual excess of disease in a small locality, although in this case the findings are likely to be related to occupational rather than environmental exposure.},

Design Population based cohort study. Setting England. Population More than 3.5 million registered patients aged 15-99 with a diagnosis of one of the 24 most common primary, malignant, invasive neoplasms between 1996 and 2013. Main outcome measures Age standardised net survival estimates by cancer, sex, year, and deprivation group. These estimates were modelled using regression model with splines to explore changes in the cancer survival trends and in the socioeconomic inequalities in survival. Results One year net survival improved steadily from 1996 for 26 of 41 sex-cancer combinations studied, and only from 2001 or 2006 for four cancers. Trends in survival accelerated after 2006 for five cancers. The deprivation gap observed for all 41 sex-cancer combinations among patients with a diagnosis in 1996 persisted until 2013. However, the gap slightly decreased for six cancers among men for which one year survival was more than 65\% in 1996, and for cervical and uterine cancers, for which survival was more than 75\% in 1996. The deprivation gap widened notably for brain tumours in men and for lung cancer in women. Conclusions Little evidence was found of a direct impact of national cancer strategies on one year survival, and no evidence for a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival. These findings emphasise that socioeconomic inequalities in survival remain a major public health problem for a healthcare system founded on equity.},

  abstract = {Background Counties are the smallest unit for which mortality data are routinely available, allowing consistent and comparable long-term analysis of trends in health disparities. Average life expectancy has steadily increased in the United States but there is limited information on long-term mortality trends in the US counties This study aimed to investigate trends in county mortality and cross-county mortality disparities, including the contributions of specific diseases to county level mortality trends. Methods and Findings We used mortality statistics (from the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]) and population (from the US Census) to estimate sex-specific life expectancy for US counties for every year between 1961 and 1999. Data for analyses in subsequent years were not provided to us by the NCHS. We calculated different metrics of cross-county mortality disparity, and also grouped counties on the basis of whether their mortality changed favorably or unfavorably relative to the national average. We estimated the probability of death from specific diseases for counties with above- or below-average mortality performance. We simulated the effect of cross-county migration on each county's life expectancy using a time-based simulation model. Between 1961 and 1999, the standard deviation (SD) of life expectancy across US counties was at its lowest in 1983, at 1.9 and 1.4 y for men and women, respectively. Cross-county life expectancy SD increased to 2.3 and 1.7 y in 1999. Between 1961 and 1983 no counties had a statistically significant increase in mortality; the major cause of mortality decline for both sexes was reduction in cardiovascular mortality. From 1983 to 1999, life expectancy declined significantly in 11 counties for men (by 1.3 y) and in 180 counties for women (by 1.3 y); another 48 (men) and 783 (women) counties had nonsignificant life expectancy decline. Life expectancy decline in both sexes was caused by increased mortality from lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and a range of other noncommunicable diseases, which were no longer compensated for by the decline in cardiovascular mortality. Higher HIV/AIDS and homicide deaths also contributed substantially to life expectancy decline for men, but not for women. Alternative specifications of the effects of migration showed that the rise in cross-county life expectancy SD was unlikely to be caused by migration. Conclusions There was a steady increase in mortality inequality across the US counties between 1983 and 1999, resulting from stagnation or increase in mortality among the worst-off segment of the population. Female mortality increased in a large number of counties, primarily because of chronic diseases related to smoking, overweight and obesity, and high blood pressure.},

  abstract = {Improving health worldwide will require rigorous quantification of population-level trends in health status. However, global-level surveys are not available, forcing researchers to rely on fragmentary country-specific data of varying quality. We present a Bayesian model that systematically combines disparate data to make country-, region- and global-level estimates of time trends in important health indicators. The model allows for time and age nonlinearity, and it borrows strength in time, age, covariates, and within and across regional country clusters to make estimates where data are sparse. The Bayesian approach allows us to account for uncertainty from the various aspects of missingness as well as sampling and parameter uncertainty. MCMC sampling allows for inference in a high-dimensional, constrained parameter space, while providing posterior draws that allow straightforward inference on the wide variety of functionals of interest. Here we use blood pressure as an example health metric. High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. The results highlight a risk transition, with decreasing blood pressure in high-income regions and increasing levels in many lower-income regions.},

  abstract = {While the framework of Gaussian process priors for functions is very flexible and has a number of advantages, its use within a fully Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework has been limited due to computational constraints. Most often, simple models are fit, with hyperparameters learned by maximum likelihood. But this approach understates the posterior uncertainty in inference. We consider priors over kernel hyperparameters, thus inducing a very flexible Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework in which we perform inference using MCMC not just for the posterior function but also for the posterior over the kernel hyperparameters. We address the central challenge of computational efficiency with MCMC by exploiting separable structure in the covariance matrix corresponding to the kernel, yielding significant gains in time and memory efficiency. Our method can be conveniently implemented in a probabilistic programming language (Stan), is widely applicable to any setting involving structured kernels, and immediately enables a number of useful features, including kernel learning through novel prior specifications, learning nonparametric priors over categorical variables, clustering through a factor analysis approach, and missing observations. We demonstrate our methods on real and synthetic spatiotemporal datasets.},

This paper argues that universalizing this theory only partially serves to explain mortality declines over the last century and eclipses key epidemiologic differences between population subgroups based on socioeconomic status, race, and sex. This paper examines morbidity and mortality differentials between population subgroups and demonstrates important inconsistencies with the optimistic trends implied by the epidemiologic transition theory, an argument further developed using the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a case study. The paper argues that these differences should be brought from margins to center to present a more complex and comprehensive picture of how population subgroups experience epidemiologic transitions differently.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate the association of aircraft noise with risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease in the general population. Design Small area study. Setting 12 London boroughs and nine districts west of London exposed to aircraft noise related to Heathrow airport in London. Population About 3.6 million residents living near Heathrow airport. Risks for hospital admissions were assessed in 12 110 census output areas (average population about 300 inhabitants) and risks for mortality in 2378 super output areas (about 1500 inhabitants). Main outcome measures Risk of hospital admissions for, and mortality from, stroke, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease, 2001-05. Results Hospital admissions showed statistically significant linear trends (P{$<$}0.001 to P{$<$}0.05) of increasing risk with higher levels of both daytime (average A weighted equivalent noise 7 am to 11 pm, LAeq,16h) and night time (11 pm to 7 am, Lnight) aircraft noise. When areas experiencing the highest levels of daytime aircraft noise were compared with those experiencing the lowest levels ({$>$}63 dB v {$\leq$}51 dB), the relative risk of hospital admissions for stroke was 1.24 (95\% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.43), for coronary heart disease was 1.21 (1.12 to 1.31), and for cardiovascular disease was 1.14 (1.08 to 1.20) adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, and a smoking proxy (lung cancer mortality) using a Poisson regression model including a random effect term to account for residual heterogeneity. Corresponding relative risks for mortality were of similar magnitude, although with wider confidence limits. Admissions for coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease were particularly affected by adjustment for South Asian ethnicity, which needs to be considered in interpretation. All results were robust to adjustment for particulate matter (PM10) air pollution, and road traffic noise, possible for London boroughs (population about 2.6 million). We could not distinguish between the effects of daytime or night time noise as these measures were highly correlated. Conclusion High levels of aircraft noise were associated with increased risks of stroke, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease for both hospital admissions and mortality in areas near Heathrow airport in London. As well as the possibility of causal associations, alternative explanations such as residual confounding and potential for ecological bias should be considered.},

We start with a review of methods for separate analyses of diseases, then move to ecological regression approaches, where the rates from one of the diseases enter as surrogate covariates for exposure. Finally, we propose a general framework for jointly modelling the variation of two or more diseases, some of which share latent spatial fields, but with possibly different risk gradients. In our application, we consider mortality data on oral, oesophagus, larynx and lung cancers for males in Germany, which all share smoking as a common risk factor. Furthermore, the first three cancers are also known to be related to excessive alcohol consumption. An empirical comparison of the different models based on a formal model criterion as well as on the posterior precision of the relative risk estimates strongly suggests that the joint modelling approach is a useful and valuable extension over individual analyses.},

However, although these findings have led the pension industry to reduce estimates of future liabilities, they have failed to elicit any significant concern in the Department of Health and Social Care. In this essay, we review the evidence on changing life expectancy, noting that the problems are greatest among older women. We then estimate the gap between what life expectancy is now and what it might have been had previous trends continued. At age 85, the gap is 0.34 years for women and 0.23 for men. We argue that recent changes cannot be dismissed as a temporary aberration. While the causes of this phenomenon are contested, there is growing evidence to point to the austerity policies implemented in recent years as at least a partial explanation. We conclude by calling for a fully independent enquiry to ascertain what is happening to life expectancy in England and Wales and what should be done about it.},

Preliminary investigations revealed an excess risk of mortality from kidney disease in people living nearest to several point sources of pollution, using distance as a proxy for exposure. Ongoing epidemiological investigations into the effect of ambient mercury exposure on dose and renal effect required a more refined assessment of exposure. Methods: Atmospheric dispersion modelling was used to assess mercury dispersion from three mercury-emitting sources (including a large chlor alkali plant), based on knowledge of emissions, local meteorology and topography. Results: The model was sensitive to various input parameters, with different dispersion patterns and ground-level concentrations, and therefore different exposed populations identified when different input parameters were defined. The different approaches to exposure assessment also had an impact on the epidemiological findings. The model output correlated well with weekly monitoring data collected in the local area, although the model underestimated concentrations in close proximity to the chlor alkali plant. The model identified that one point source did not contribute significantly to ground-level mercury concentrations, so that inclusion of this source when using the ``distance as a proxy'' approach led to significant exposure misclassification. Conclusions: The model output indicates that assessment of ambient exposure should give consideration to the magnitude of emissions, point source characteristics, local meteorology and topography to ensure that the most appropriate exposure classification is reached. Even if dispersion modelling cannot be undertaken, these data can be used to inform and improve the distance as a proxy approach, and improve the interpretability of the epidemiological findings.},

Risks of cancers at the above sites were computed with adjustment for age, sex, year of diagnosis, region and deprivation. National post-coded registers provided a total of 341856640 person\textendash years for the adult cancer analyses and 113631443 person\textendash years for childhood leukaemia. There were 89786 cases of bladder cancer, 36802 cases of brain cancer, 21773 cases of hepatobiliary cancer, 37812 cases of adult leukaemia and 3973 cases of childhood leukaemia. In spite of the very large scale of this national study, we found no excess risks of cancers of the bladder and brain, hepatobiliary cancer or leukaemia, in populations living within 2\,km of landfill sites. The results were similar if the analysis were restricted to landfill sites licensed to carry special (hazardous) waste. Our results do not support suggestions of excess risks of cancer associated with landfill sites reported in other studies.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer incidence has increased during recent years, possibly linked to environmental exposures. Exposure to environmental carcinogens is unlikely to be evenly distributed geographically, which may give rise to variations in disease occurrence that is detectable in a spatial analysis. The aim of our study was to examine the spatial variation of prostate cancer in Great Britain at ages 45\textendash 64 years. Spatial variation was examined across electoral wards from 1975\textendash 1991. Poisson regression was used to examine regional, urbanisation and socioeconomic effects, while Bayesian mapping techniques were used to assess spatial variability. There was an indication of geographical differences in prostate cancer risk at a regional level, ranging from 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.78\textendash 0.87) to 1.2 (95\% CI: 1.1\textendash 1.3) across regions. There was significant heterogeneity in the risk across wards, although the range of relative risks was narrow. More detailed spatial analyses within 4 regions did not indicate any clear evidence of localised geographical clustering for prostate cancer. The absence of any marked geographical variability at a small-area scale argues against a geographically varying environmental factor operating strongly in the aetiology of prostate cancer. \textcopyright{} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Methods A 2-km zone around 6289 landfill sites processing special (hazardous), non-special and unknown waste type was used to indicate exposure. Postcodes within the 2-km zone were classified as `exposed' and people living beyond 2 km comprised the reference population. Health outcome data were Down syndrome registrations from a national registry including 21 cytogenetic laboratories in England and Wales, for the years 1989 to 1998. With a Bayesian regression model, we calculated relative risks for the population living within 2 km of landfill sites relative to the reference population, assuming a common relative risk for all landfill sites. Adjustments were made for major confounders. Results There were 4640 cases of Down syndrome within 2 km of a landfill site. We found no excess risks of Down syndrome related to landfill sites. Adjustment for socio-economic status (SES) did not influence our estimates. There were no differences in risk between hazardous waste sites and other landfill sites.

Of these measures, life expectancies are generally preferred based on their simpler interpretation and direct age standardization, which makes them directly comparable between different populations. However, traditional life expectancy estimations are highly inaccurate for smaller populations and consequently are seldom used in small-area applications. In this paper, the authors compare the relative performance of traditional life expectancy estimation with a Bayesian random-effects approach that uses correlations (i.e., borrows strength) between different age groups, geographic areas, and sexes to improve the small-area life expectancy estimations. In the presented Monte Carlo simulations, the Bayesian random-effects approach outperforms the traditional approach in terms of bias, root mean square error, and coverage of the 95\% confidence intervals. Moreover, the Bayesian random-effects approach is found to be usable for populations as small as 2,000 person-years at risk, which is considerably smaller than the minimum of 5,000 person-years at risk recommended for the traditional approach. As such, the proposed Bayesian random-effects approach is well-suited for estimation of life expectancies in small areas.},

  abstract = {A valuable public health practice is to examine disease incidence and mortality rates across geographic regions. The data available for the construction of disease maps are typically in the form of aggregate counts within sets of disjoint, politically defined areas, and the Poisson variation inherent in these counts can lead to extreme raw rates in small areas. Relative risks tend to be similar in neighboring areas, and a common approach is to use random-effects models that allow estimation of relative risk in an area to ``borrow strength'' from neighboring areas, thus producing more stable estimation. Often a Markov random field structure is assumed to model the spatial dependence due to unmeasured risk factors. Such models consider the distribution of the relative risk of an area conditional on its neighbors, although the neighborhood schemes are typically defined only very simplistically. For example, two areas may be viewed as neighbors if they share a common boundary, in which case the relative positions, sizes, and shapes of the areas are not taken into account. In this article we describe a new method in which the correlation structure is derived through consideration of an underlying continuous risk surface. Specifically, we model the log relative risk as a Gaussian random field, a modeling approach that has seen extensive use in the geostatistics literature. We approximate the distribution of the area-level relative risks to provide an analytically tractable form. This leads to more realistic correlation structures between neighboring areas, and allows estimation not only of individual area-level relative risks, but also of the continuous underlying relative risk function. We first explore and illustrate our methods with simulated data. We then analyze a set of data on colorectal cancer in the U.K. district of Birmingham. The aims of the analysis were to investigate the extent of spatial variability and to investigate the extent to which this variability was associated with an area-level measure of socioeconomic status.},

  abstract = {The study of spatial variations in disease rates is a common epidemiological approach used to describe the geographical clustering of diseases and to generate hypotheses about the possible 'causes' which could explain apparent differences in risk. Recent statistical and computational developments have led to the use of realistically complex models to account for overdispersion and spatial correlation. However, these developments have focused almost exclusively on spatial modelling of a single disease. Many diseases share common risk factors (smoking being an obvious example) and, if similar patterns of geographical variation of related diseases can be identified, this may provide more convincing evidence of real clustering in the underlying risk surface. We propose a shared component model for the joint spatial analysis of two diseases. The key idea is to separate the underlying risk surface for each disease into a shared and a disease-specific component. The various components of this formulation are modelled simultaneously by using spatial cluster models implemented via reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the methodology through an analysis of oral and oesophageal cancer mortality in the 544 districts of Germany, 1986-1990.},

Results:               Over this year, there were 1,410,300 (95\% credible interval 1,267,600-1,579,200) excess deaths in these countries, equivalent to a 15\% (14-17) increase, and 141 (127-158) additional deaths per 100,000 people.

The USA, Czechia, Slovakia and Poland experienced {$>$}20\% higher mortality. Within the USA, Hawaii experienced no detectable change in mortality and Maine a 5\% increase, contrasting with New Jersey, Arizona, Mississippi, Texas, California, Louisiana and New York which experienced {$>$}25\% higher mortality.

Another advance to strengthen inference of disease data is the extension of purely spatial models to includetime aspect. We aim to combine the idea of multivariate shared components with spatio-temporal modelling in a jointdisease mapping model and apply it for incidence rates of seven prevalent cancers in Iran which together account forapproximately 50\% of all cancers. Methods: In the proposed model, each component is shared by different subsetsof diseases, spatial and temporal trends are considered for each component, and the relative weight of these trends foreach component for each relevant disease can be estimated. Results: For esophagus and stomach cancers the Northernprovinces was the area of high risk. For colorectal cancer Gilan, Semnan, Fars, Isfahan, Yazd and East-Azerbaijanwere the highest risk provinces. For bladder and lung cancer, the northwest were the highest risk area. For prostate andbreast cancers, Isfahan, Yazd, Fars, Tehran, Semnan, Mazandaran and Khorasane-Razavi were the highest risk part.The smoking component, shared by esophagus, stomach, bladder and lung, had more effect in Gilan, Mazandaran,Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Kohgilouyeh and Boyerahmad, Ardebil and Tehran provinces, in turn. For overweightand obesity component, shared by esophagus, colorectal, prostate and breast cancers the largest effect was found forTehran, Khorasane-Razavi, Semnan, Yazd, Isfahan, Fars, Mazandaran and Gilan, in turn. For low physical activitycomponent, shared by colorectal and breast cancers North-Khorasan, Ardebil, Golestan, Ilam, Khorasane-Razavi andSouth-Khorasan had the largest effects, in turn. The smoking component is significantly more important for stomachthan for esophagus, bladder and lung. The overweight and obesity had significantly more effect for colorectal than ofesophagus cancer.

Between 1985 and 1988 we investigated the degree and causes of the social gradient in morbidity in a new cohort of 10 314 civil servants (6900 men, 3414 women) aged 35-55 (the Whitehall II study). Participants were asked to answer a self-administered questionnaire and attend a screening examination. In the 20 years separating the two studies there has been no diminution in social class difference in morbidity: we found an inverse association between employment grade and prevalence of angina, electrocardiogram evidence of ischaemia, and symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Self-perceived health status and symptoms were worse in subjects in lower status jobs. There were clear employmentgrade differences in health-risk behaviours including smoking, diet, and exercise, in economic circumstances, in possible effects of early-life environment as reflected by height, in social circumstances at work (eg, monotonous work characterised by low control and low satisfaction), and in social supports. Healthy behaviours should be encouraged across the whole of society; more attention should be paid to the social environments, job design, and the consequences of income inequality.},

  abstract = {In the Whitehall study, 17 530 civil servants were classified according to employment grade, and their mortality was recorded over 10 years. There was a steep inverse relation between grade and mortality. Compared with the highest grade (administrators), men in the lowest grade had 3 times the mortality rate from coronary heart disease, from a range of other causes, and from all causes combined. This is larger than the mortality differences, nationally, between classes I and V. Smoking and other coronary risk factors are more common in the lowest grades, but these differences account for only part of the mortality difference. The similarity of the risk gradient from a range of specific diseases could indicate the operation of factors affecting general susceptibility. The inverse relation between height and mortality suggests that factors operating from early life may influence adult death rates.},

  abstract = {The causes of death reported on the death certificates of the oldest old are generally seen as unreliable, and as thus providing little useful information on the process leading to death. However, in advanced countries, a majority of the people who die each year are relatively old, and the level of detail provided on medical certificates about the causes of death among this older population is improving. At the same time, scholars are becoming increasingly interested in studying not just the initial cause of death, but multiple causes of death, thereby taking all of the information reported on the certificate into account. This study demonstrates that in a country like France, the cause-of-death pattern evolves regularly until around age 105. The share of people dying of circulatory diseases tends to be quite stable over the age range, while the share of individuals dying of cancer is~declining, and the share of people dying of respiratory/infectious diseases is~rising. Furthermore, among people who die at very old ages, a typology of multiple causes of death highlights the growing importance of ill-defined causes, while opening the door to an interesting discussion about the concept of cause of death in the supercentenarian population. Instead of representing an ill-defined cause, senility could be considered an actual cause of death. This suggests that daily care is more crucial to the survival of the oldest old than any conventional medical care or treatment. Supercentenarians tend to be so frail that any minor health event or brief lapse of attention on the part of their caregivers can be lethal.},

Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from 29 cancers: lip and oral cavity; nasopharynx; other pharynx; esophageal; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; gallbladder and biliary; pancreatic; larynx; tracheal, bronchus, and lung; malignant skin melanoma; nonmelanoma skin cancer; breast; cervical; uterine; ovarian; prostate; testicular; kidney; bladder; brain and nervous system; thyroid; mesothelioma; Hodgkin lymphoma; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; multiple myeloma; leukemia; and all other cancers combined.County of residence.Age-standardized cancer mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cancer type.A total of 19\,511\,910 cancer deaths were recorded in the United States between 1980 and 2014, including 5\,656\,423 due to tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer; 2\,484\,476 due to colon and rectum cancer; 1\,573\,593 due to breast cancer; 1\,077\,030 due to prostate cancer; 1\,157\,878 due to pancreatic cancer; 209\,314 due to uterine cancer; 421\,628 due to kidney cancer; 487\,518 due to liver cancer; 13\,927 due to testicular cancer; and 829\,396 due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer mortality decreased by 20.1\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 18.2\%-21.4\%) between 1980 and 2014, from 240.2 (95\% UI, 235.8-244.1) to 192.0 (95\% UI, 188.6-197.7) deaths per 100\,000 population. There were large differences in the mortality rate among counties throughout the period: in 1980, cancer mortality ranged from 130.6 (95\% UI, 114.7-146.0) per 100\,000 population in Summit County, Colorado, to 386.9 (95\% UI, 330.5-450.7) in North Slope Borough, Alaska, and in 2014 from 70.7 (95\% UI, 63.2-79.0) in Summit County, Colorado, to 503.1 (95\% UI, 464.9-545.4) in Union County, Florida. For many cancers, there were distinct clusters of counties with especially high mortality. The location of these clusters varied by type of cancer and were spread in different regions of the United States. Clusters of breast cancer were present in the southern belt and along the Mississippi River, while liver cancer was high along the Texas-Mexico border, and clusters of kidney cancer were observed in North and South Dakota and counties in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, and Illinois.Cancer mortality declined overall in the United States between 1980 and 2014. Over this same period, there were important changes in trends, patterns, and differences in cancer mortality among US counties. These patterns may inform further research into improving prevention and treatment.},

Because of the interaction and the multiple causal pathways between these various factors (e.g., obesity can lead to lack of physical exercise and poor health but poor health can also lead to lack of physical exercise and obesity), the exact amount that each factor contributes to the observed health differentials remains unknown. Yet one finding seems clear: having the highest level of cigarette consumption per capita in the developed world over a 40-year period (up to the mid-1980s) has left a very visible and continuing imprint on U.S. mortality.},

  abstract = {In the present paper, the theory of the Epidemiologic Transition is applied to describe the population and health dynamics in the United States during the last century. The data presented indicate that the U.S. experience belongs to what is referred to as the ``Classical'' model. The mortality decline in the U.S. occurred during the latter 19th century and marked a shift from pandemics of infection to degenerative and man-made diseases. The transition favored children more than the old, females more than males, and whites more than nonwhites. Mortality decline in 19th century U.S. owed little to medical progress, sanitation measures, or organized health services. More important determinants were improvements in living standards, personal hygiene, nutrition, housing, and ecologic recession of certain diseases. Fertility in the U.S. started to decline toward the end of the 19th century, a decline that was primarily socially determined. In recent decades, however, the organized element has become visible. The theory of the Epidemiologic Transition can be applied to other populations as well and can be helpful in determining the directions to take in efforts to control population growth. The fact that the theory distinguishes three different models of the transition alerts population students and policymakers to the fallacy of applying the population dynamics and solutions of one model to countries belonging to a different model.},

  abstract = {Background Few studies have investigated congenital anomalies in relation to municipal waste incinerators (MWIs) and results are inconclusive. Objectives To conduct a national investigation into the risk of congenital anomalies in babies born to mothers living within 10\,km of an MWI associated with: i) modelled concentrations of PM10 as a proxy for MWI emissions more generally and; ii) proximity of residential postcode to nearest MWI, in areas in England and Scotland that are covered by a congenital anomaly register. Methods Retrospective population-based cohort study within 10\,km of 10 MWIs in England and Scotland operating between 2003 and 2010. Exposure was proximity to MWI and log of daily mean modelled ground-level particulate matter {$\leq$}10\,{$\mu$}m diameter (PM10) concentrations. Results Analysis included 219,486 births, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly of which 5154 were cases of congenital anomalies. Fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) per doubling in PM10 was: 1{$\cdot$}00 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}98\textendash 1{$\cdot$}02) for all congenital anomalies; 0{$\cdot$}99 (0{$\cdot$}97\textendash 1{$\cdot$}01) for all congenital anomalies excluding chromosomal anomalies. For every 1\,km closer to an MWI adjusted OR was: 1{$\cdot$}02 (1{$\cdot$}00\textendash 1{$\cdot$}04) for all congenital anomalies combined; 1{$\cdot$}02 (1{$\cdot$}00\textendash 1{$\cdot$}04) for all congenital anomalies excluding chromosomal anomalies; and, for specific anomaly groups, 1{$\cdot$}04 (1{$\cdot$}01\textendash 1{$\cdot$}08) for congenital heart defect sand 1{$\cdot$}07 (1{$\cdot$}02\textendash 1{$\cdot$}12) for genital anomalies. Discussion We found no increased risk of congenital anomalies in relation to modelled PM10 emissions, but there were small excess risks associated with congenital heart defects and genital anomalies in proximity to MWIs. These latter findings may well reflect incomplete control for confounding, but a possible causal effect cannot be excluded.},

  abstract = {Model patterns of the cause structure of mortality at different levels were established for males and females, based on data for 165 national populations. These patterns suggest that the cause of death most responsible for mortality variation is influenza/bronchitis, followed by `other infectious and parasitic diseases', respiratory tuberculosis, and diarrhoeal disease. Together, these causes typically account for about 60 per cent of the change in level of mortality from all causes combined. Their respective contributions have not depended in an important way on the initial level of mortality. These results \textemdash{} especially tbe importance of the respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases \textemdash{} imply that past accounts may have over-emphasized the role in mortality decline of specific and well-defined infectious diseases and their corresponding methods of control. There is strong statistical support for the suggestion that most of the remainder of mortality variation should be ascribed to changes in cardio-vascular diseases, but that methods of cause-of-death assignment in high-mortality populations have often obscured the importance of these diseases. When death rates from `other and unknown' causes are held constant, changes in cardio-vascular disease account for about one-quarter of the decline in mortality from `all causes'.Although the causal factors are poorly established, corroborative results have been demonstrated cross-sectionally in the United States. The composition of the group of populations most deviant from the structural norms is apparently dominated by differentials in the mode of assigning deaths to cardio-vascular disease. However, when broad groups of regions or periods are distinguished, more subtle differences emerge. Controlling mortality level for all causes combined, diarrhoeal diseases are significantly higher in non-Western populations and southern/eastern Europe than in overseas Europe or northern/western Europe. These differences are probably related to standards of nutrition and personal hygiene, but may also reflect climatic factors. Much higher cardio-vascular mortality in overseas European populations than in non-Western populations at similar overall levels probably reflects variation in habits of life. Regional differences in death rates from violence, maternal mortality, respiratory tuberculosis and influenza/pneumonia/bronchitis are briefly noted and commented upon. Cause-of-death structures at a particular level of mortality display some important changes over time. Respiratory tuberculosis and `other infectious and parasitic diseases' have tended to contribute less and less to a certain level of mortality. They have in part been `replaced' by diarrhoeal disease, specifically in non-Western populations. These developments reflect an accelerating rate of medical and public health progress against the specific infectious diseases, and a disappointing rate of progress against diarrhoeal disease. Western and non-western populations have shared to approximately the same extent in the accelerating progress against infectious diseases, and developments during the post-war period are more appropriately viewed as an extension of prior trends rather than as radical departures therefrom. For males, cardio-vascular disease and cancer have significantly increased their contribution to a particular level of mortality, while no such tendency is apparent for females. These developments may be related to changes in personal behaviour and in environmental influences whose differential impact on the sexes has been demonstrated in epidemiological studies. Although we have avoided an explicit treatment of age by having recourse at the outset to standardization, certain of the results are apparently reflected in studies of age patterns of mortality. The joint occurrence in non-Western populations and Southern/Eastern populations of exceptionally high death rates from diarrhoeal disease may explain why the `South' age-pattern, with it high death rates between ages one and five, is often the most accurate referent for use in Latin America and Asia. The fact that the list of populations with the least deviation cause structure is almost exclusively confined to members of the `West' group of Coale and Demeny may account for the lack of persistent deviation in this group's age patterns. Finally, tbe increasing importance of cardio-vascular disease and neoplasms in cause-of-death structures for males but not females is probably associated with the changing age patterns of male mortality noted by Coale and Demeny.},

Many of these results are proved using direct coupling constructions based on minorisation and drift conditions. Necessary and sufficient conditions for Central Limit Theorems (CLTs) are also presented, in some cases proved via the Poisson Equation or direct regeneration constructions. Finally, optimal scaling and weak convergence results for Metropolis-Hastings algorithms are discussed. None of the results presented is new, though many of the proofs are.

  abstract = {For decades, researchers have noted systematic shifts in cause-of-death patterns as mortality levels change. The notion of the "epidemiologic transition" has influenced thinking about the evolution of health in different societies and the response of the health system to these changes. This article re-examines the epidemiologic transition in terms of empirical regularities in the cause composition of mortality by age and sex since 1950, and considers whether the theory of epidemiologic transition presents a durable framework for understanding more recent patterns. Age-sex-specific mortality rates from three broad cause groups are analyzed: Group 1 (communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal causes, and nutritional deficiencies); Group 2 (noncommunicable diseases); and Group 3 (injuries), using the most extensive international database on mortality by cause, including 1,576 country-years of observation, and new statistical models for compositional data. The analyses relate changes in cause-of-death patterns to changing levels of all-cause mortality and income per capita. The results confirm that declines in overall mortality are accompanied by systematic changes in the composition of causes in many age groups. These changes are most pronounced among children, for whom Group 1 causes decline as overall mortality falls, and in younger adults, where strikingly different patterns are found for men (shift from Group 3 to Group 2) compared to women (shift toward Group 2 then Group 3). The underlying patterns that emerge from this analysis offer insights into the epidemiologic transition from high-mortality to low-mortality settings.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs), implemented through multivariate Gaussian distributions for a finite collection of data, are the most popular approach in small-area spatial statistical modelling. In this context, they are used to encode correlation structures over space and can generalize well in interpolation tasks. Despite their flexibility, off-the-shelf GPs present serious computational challenges which limit their scalability and practical usefulness in applied settings. Here, we propose a novel, deep generative modelling approach to tackle this challenge, termed PriorVAE: for a particular spatial setting, we approximate a class of GP priors through prior sampling and subsequent fitting of a variational autoencoder (VAE). Given a trained VAE, the resultant decoder allows spatial inference to become incredibly efficient due to the low dimensional, independently distributed latent Gaussian space representation of the VAE. Once trained, inference using the VAE decoder replaces the GP within a Bayesian sampling framework. This approach provides tractable and easy-to-implement means of approximately encoding spatial priors and facilitates efficient statistical inference. We demonstrate the utility of our VAE two-stage approach on Bayesian, small-area estimation tasks.},

SETTING A health district in Trent Region, England. SUBJECTS Routinely available mortality statistics at electoral ward level and above. MAIN RESULTS Given reasonable and simple assumptions the sampling distribution of the expectation of life is approximately normal. Expectation of life shows a high negative correlation with SMR even if the oldest age band for the SMR is open ended. CONCLUSIONS Where sampling error is an issue, inference concerning differences in mortality rates between populations can be based on expectation of life, which is better for illustrative purposes than SMR. The formula for the variance of the expectation of life is more complex however. If the final age band is open ended, its lower bound should be as high as possible to avoid misleading results caused by hidden differences in age structure.},

Outcome measures Key performance measures of Chiang II, Silcocks, adjusted Chiang II and Bayesian random effects model methodologies of life expectancy estimation including agreement analysis of life expectancy estimates and comparison of estimate SEs. Results Chiang II and Silcocks methods produced almost identical life expectancy estimates across a large range of population sizes but calculation failures and excessively large SEs limited their use in small populations. A population of 25 000 or greater was required to estimate life expectancy with SE of 1 year or less using adjusted Chiang II (a composite of Chiang II and Silcocks methods). Data aggregation offered some remedy for extending the use of adjusted Chiang II in small populations but reduced estimate currency. A recently developed Bayesian random effects model utilising the correlation in mortality rates between genders, age groups and geographical areas markedly improved the precision of life expectancy estimates in small populations. Conclusions We propose a hybrid approach for the calculation of life expectancy using the Bayesian random effects model in populations of 25 000 or lower permitting the precise derivation of life expectancy in small populations. In populations above 25 000, we propose the use of adjusted Chiang II to guard against violations of spatial correlation, to benefit from a widely accepted method that is simpler to communicate to local health authorities and where its slight inferior performance compared with the Bayesian approach is of minor practical significance.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine whether there were inequalities in the sustained rise in infant mortality in England in recent years and the contribution of rising child poverty to these trends. Design This is an analysis of trends in infant mortality in local authorities grouped into five categories (quintiles) based on their level of income deprivation. Fixed-effects regression models were used to quantify the association between regional changes in child poverty and regional changes in infant mortality. Setting 324 English local authorities in 9 English government office regions. Participants Live-born children under 1 year of age. Main outcome measure Infant mortality rate, defined as the number of deaths in children under 1 year of age per 100 000 live births in the same year. Results The sustained and unprecedented rise in infant mortality in England from 2014 to 2017 was not experienced evenly across the population. In the most deprived local authorities, the previously declining trend in infant mortality reversed and mortality rose, leading to an additional 24 infant deaths per 100 000 live births per year (95\% CI 6 to 42), relative to the previous trend. There was no significant change from the pre-existing trend in the most affluent local authorities. As a result, inequalities in infant mortality increased, with the gap between the most and the least deprived local authority areas widening by 52 deaths per 100 000 births (95\% CI 36 to 68). Overall from 2014 to 2017, there were a total of 572 excess infant deaths (95\% CI 200 to 944) compared with what would have been expected based on historical trends. We estimated that each 1\% increase in child poverty was significantly associated with an extra 5.8 infant deaths per 100 000 live births (95\% CI 2.4 to 9.2). The findings suggest that about a third of the increases in infant mortality between 2014 and 2017 can be attributed to rising child poverty (172 deaths, 95\% CI 74 to 266). Conclusion This study provides evidence that the unprecedented rise in infant mortality disproportionately affected the poorest areas of the country, leaving the more affluent areas unaffected. Our analysis also linked the recent increase in infant mortality in England with rising child poverty, suggesting that about a third of the increase in infant mortality from 2014 to 2017 may be attributed to rising child poverty.},

  abstract = {Objectives A four-stage model of the cigarette epidemic was proposed in 1994 to communicate the long delay between the widespread uptake of cigarette smoking and its full effects on mortality, as had been experienced in economically developed countries where cigarette smoking became entrenched decades earlier in men than in women. In the present work, the question of whether qualitative predictions from the model have matched recent trends in smoking and deaths from smoking in countries at various levels of economic development is assessed, and possible projections to the year 2025 are considered. Methods The proportion of all deaths attributed to tobacco was estimated indirectly for 41 high-resource and medium-resource countries from 1950 to the most recent year for which data were available, generally about 2005\textendash 2009. The trends in tobacco-attributed mortality in later middle age were then projected forward to 2025, based on recent trends in tobacco-attributed mortality in early middle age. Results In developed countries the prevalence of smoking has continued to decrease in both sexes, although the rate of decrease has slowed and is less than that predicted by the original version of the model. Over the past 20 years the proportionate contribution of smoking to all deaths has decreased in men while continuing to increase or plateau among women. Although the proportion of all deaths at ages 35\textendash 69 that are attributed to smoking is still generally greater in men than in women, the male and female proportions are converging and will probably cross over in some high resource countries. Projections through to 2025 suggest that male and female smoking prevalence and smoking-attributed mortality will decrease in parallel in most developed countries towards lower limits that are not yet defined. In developing countries the model seems generally applicable to men but cannot predict whether or when women will begin smoking in large numbers. Modified criteria that describe the stages of the epidemic separately for men and women would be more generalisable to developing countries. Conclusions The four-stage model of the cigarette epidemic still provides a reasonably useful description in many developed countries. Its relevance to developing countries could be improved by describing the stages of the epidemic separately for men and women.},

  abstract = {Increases in testicular cancer incidence have been reported in several countries over a long period. Geographical variability has also been reported in some studies. We have investigated temporal trends and spatial variation of testicular cancer at ages 20\textendash 49 in Britain. Temporal trends in testicular cancer incidence were examined, 1974 to 1991 and in mortality, 1981\textendash 1997. Spatial variation in incidence was analysed across electoral wards, 1975 to 1991. We used Poisson regression to examine for regional and socio-economic effects and Bayesian mapping techniques to analyse small-area spatial variability. Incidence increased from 6.5 to 11.1 per 100 000 in men at ages 20\textendash 34, and from 5.6 to 9.7 per 100 000 in men at ages 35\textendash 49, while mortality declined by 50\% in both age groups. Risks of testicular cancer varied across regional cancer registries, ranging from 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.73\textendash 0.84) to 1.32 (95\% CI: 1.25\textendash 1.38), and was higher in the most affluent compared with the most deprived areas. Analyses within 2 regions (one predominantly urban, the other predominantly rural) did not indicate any localized geographical clustering. The increasing incidence contrasted with a decreasing mortality over time in Great Britain, similar to that found in other countries. The higher risk in more affluent areas is not consistent with findings on social class at the individual level. The absence of any marked geographical variability at small area scale argues against a geographically varying environmental factor operating strongly in the aetiology of testicular cancer.},

Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, and manual screening of references. Eligibility criteria Meta-analyses or systematic reviews of observational studies in humans that examined the association between type 2 diabetes and risk of developing or dying from cancer. Results Eligible meta-analyses assessed associations between type 2 diabetes and risk of developing cancer in 20 sites and mortality for seven cancer sites. The summary random effects estimates were significant at P=0.05 in 20 meta-analyses (74\%); and all reported increased risks of developing cancer for participants with versus without diabetes. Of the 27 meta-analyses, eventually only seven (26\%) compiled evidence on more than 1000 cases, had significant summary associations at P{$\leq$}0.001 for both random and fixed effects calculations, and had neither evidence of small study effects nor evidence for excess significance. Of those, only six (22\%) did not have substantial heterogeneity (I2{$>$}75\%), pertaining to associations between type 2 diabetes and risk of developing breast, cholangiocarcinoma (both intrahepatic and extrahepatic), colorectal, endometrial, and gallbladder cancer. The 95\% prediction intervals excluded the null value for four of these associations (breast, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal, and endometrial cancer). Conclusions Though type 2 diabetes has been extensively studied in relation to risk of developing cancer and cancer mortality and strong claims of significance exist for most of the studied associations, only a minority of these associations have robust supporting evidence without hints of bias.},

We use a unique digital corpus of linked individual and household-level consumer registers compiled by the UK Consumer Data Research Centre, comprising over 143 million unique address records pertaining to the entire UK adult population over the period 1997\textendash 2016. We describe how records pertaining to individuals vacating a property can be assigned to their most probable residential destination, based on novel methods of matching names, assessing household composition, and using information on the date and probable distance of residential moves.

Traditional \$\textbackslash widehat\{R\}\$ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

We distinguish four types of analysis: disease mapping; geographic correlation studies; the assessment of risk in relation to a prespecified point or line source, and cluster detection and disease clustering. A general framework for the statistical analysis of small area studies will be considered. This framework assumes that populations at risk arise from inhomogeneous Poisson processes. Disease cases are then realizations of a thinned Poisson process where the risk of disease depends on the characteristics of the person, time and spatial location. Difficulties of analysis and interpretation due to data inaccuracies and aggregation will be addressed with particular reference to ecological bias and confounding.

Methods Population-based age-standardised relative survival at 1 year is estimated for 1.4 million patients diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus, stomach, colon, lung, breast (women) or cervix in England during 1991\textendash 2006 and followed up to 2007. Regional and deprivation-specific life tables are built to adjust survival estimates for differences in background mortality. Analysis is divided into three calendar periods: 1991\textendash 5, 1996\textendash 2000 and 2001\textendash 6. Funnel plots are used to assess geographical variation in survival over time. Results One-year relative survival improved for all cancers except cervical cancer. There was a wide geographical variation in survival with generally lower estimates in northern England. This north\textendash south divide became less marked over time, although the overall number of cancer networks that were lower outliers compared with the England value remained stable. Breast cancer was the only cancer for which there was a marked reduction in geographical inequality in survival over time. Conclusion Policy changes over the past two decades coincided with improved relative survival, without an increase in geographical variation. The north\textendash south divide in relative survival became less pronounced over time but geographical inequalities persist. The reduction in geographical inequality in breast cancer survival may be followed by a similar trend for other cancers, provided government recommendations are implemented similarly.},

  abstract = {It is often observed that mortality projections are more pessimistic when disaggregated by cause of death. This article explores the generality and strength of this relationship under a variety of forecasting models. First, a simple measure of the pessimism inherent in cause-based mortality forecasts is derived. Second, it is shown that the pessimism of cause-based forecasts can be approximated using only data on the distribution of deaths by cause in two previous time periods. Third, using Japanese mortality data during 1951\textendash 1990, the analysis demonstrates that the pessimism of cause-based forecasts can be attributed mainly to observed trends in mortality due to cancer and heart disease, with smaller contribution due to trends in stroke (women only), pneumonia/bronchitis, accidents, and suicide. The last point requires the important qualification, however, that observed trends in cancer and heart disease may be severely biased due to changes in diagnostic practice.},

  abstract = {Background Evidence on preventing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging to interpret due to varying study designs with heterogeneous endpoints and credibility. We completed a systematic review and meta-analysis of current evidence with prospective designs to propose evidence-based suggestions on AD prevention. Methods Electronic databases and relevant websites were searched from inception to 1 March 2019. Both observational prospective studies (OPSs) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The multivariable-adjusted effect estimates were pooled by random-effects models, with credibility assessment according to its risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision. Levels of evidence and classes of suggestions were summarised. Results A total of 44 676 reports were identified, and 243 OPSs and 153 RCTs were eligible for analysis after exclusion based on pre-decided criteria, from which 104 modifiable factors and 11 interventions were included in the meta-analyses. Twenty-one suggestions are proposed based on the consolidated evidence, with Class I suggestions targeting 19 factors: 10 with Level A strong evidence (education, cognitive activity, high body mass index in latelife, hyperhomocysteinaemia, depression, stress, diabetes, head trauma, hypertension in midlife and orthostatic hypotension) and 9 with Level B weaker evidence (obesity in midlife, weight loss in late life, physical exercise, smoking, sleep, cerebrovascular disease, frailty, atrial fibrillation and vitamin C). In contrast, two interventions are not recommended: oestrogen replacement therapy (Level A2) and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Level B). Interpretation Evidence-based suggestions are proposed, offering clinicians and stakeholders current guidance for the prevention of AD.},
