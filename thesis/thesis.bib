  abstract = {BackgroundReports of disease clusters are often received by district health authorities and are, in some cases, associated with concerns about a pollution source. The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) has developed a Rapid Inquiry Facility, which will produce an estimated relative risk for any given condition for the population within defined areas around a point source, relative to the population in a local reference region. The system can also facilitate the production of annual reports and other health studies for Departments of Public Health Medicine through the creation of ward-level maps to illustrate disease variation across small areas.Methods The facility uses routinely collected morbidity, mortality and population data at a small area scale, together with the computing facilities and expertise necessary to run such analyses quickly and efficiently. Using this facility SAHSU can supply a report within three working days. To aid interpretation, smoothed small area maps that account for sampling variability in the observed data can also be produced.Results The paper reports on two case studies where the pilot system has been utilized by health authorities for both point source analyses and small area disease mapping.Conclusions We believe that this facility would be of considerable use to districts. The local knowledge and expertise of the local public health specialist is essential in the interpretation and presentation of the facility's output. Feedback from public health specialists is helping SAHSU refine the output of the facility, so as to make the information presented as comprehensive and as useful as possible.Keywords:small areas, disease mapping, disease clusters, geographical information systems},

METHODS: We obtained population and death data between 2016 and 2018 from the National Health Information Database and constructed abridged life tables using standard life table procedures according to sex and income quintiles for the electoral constituencies of the 20th National Assembly election held in 2016. RESULTS: Life expectancy across the 253 constituencies ranged from 80.51 to 87.05 years, corresponding to a gap of 6.54 years. The life expectancy difference by income across the 253 constituencies ranged from 2.94 years to 10.67 years. In each province, the difference in life expectancy by income across electoral constituencies was generally greater than the inter-constituency differences. Constituencies in capital and metropolitan areas showed a higher life expectancy and a lower life expectancy difference by income than constituencies in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-rich inequalities in life expectancy by income existed in every electoral constituency in Korea. Both intra-constituency and inter-constituency socioeconomic inequalities in health should be highlighted in future policy-making in the National Assembly.},

The specific issues posed by the sparseness of the data and possibility for local spatial dependence belong to a generic class of statistical problems involving an underlying (latent) spatial process of interest corrupted by observational noise. These are naturally formulated within the framework of hierarchical models, and over the past decade, a variety of spatial models have been proposed for the latent level(s) of the hierarchy. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the main classes of such models that have been used for disease mapping within a Bayesian estimation paradigm, and report a performance comparison between representative models in these classes, using a set of simulated data to help illustrate their respective properties. We also consider recent extensions to model the joint spatial distribution of multiple disease or health indicators. The aim is to help the reader choose an appropriate structural prior for the second level of the hierarchical model and to discuss issues of sensitivity to this choice.},

The diabetes risk index is for 6791 English small areas (which provide entire coverage of England) and has advantages in incorporating evidence from both diabetes outcomes and area risk factors, and in including spatial correlation in its construction. The analysis underlying the risk index shows that area socio-economic status, social fragmentation and south Asian ethnic concentration are all positive risk factors for diabetes risk. However, urban-rural and regional differences in risk intersect with these socio-demographic influences.},

However, major differences in DFLE, and trends in these expectancies, exist between different neighbourhoods within regions, so supporting a small area perspective. However, this raises issues regarding the stability of conventional life table estimation methods at small area scales. This paper advocates a Bayesian borrowing strength technique to model trends in mortality and disability differences across 625 small areas in London, using illness data from the 2001 and 2011 population Censuses, and deaths data for two periods centred on the Census years. From this analysis, estimates of total life expectancy and DFLE are obtained. The spatio-temporal modelling perspective allows assessment of whether significant compression or expansion of morbidity has occurred in each small area. Appropriate models involve random effects that recognise correlation and interaction effects over relevant dimensions of the observed deaths and illness data (areas, ages), as well as major spatial trends (e.g. gradients in health and mortality according to area deprivation category). Whilst borrowing strength is a primary consideration (and demonstrated by raised precision for estimated life expectancies), so also is model parsimony. Therefore, pure borrowing strength models are compared with models allowing selection of random age-area interaction effects using a spike-slab prior, and in fact borrowing strength combined with random effects selection provides better fit.

This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity.To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.Annual county-level life tables were constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.County of residence.Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk.Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95\% UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60\%, 74\%, and 27\% of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74\% of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors.Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE--The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) was established at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in response to a recommendation of the enquiry into the increased incidence of childhood leukaemia near Sellafield, the nuclear reprocessing plant in West Cumbria. The aim of this paper was to describe the Unit's methods for the investigation of health around point sources of environmental pollution in the United Kingdom. DESIGN--Routine data currently including deaths and cancer registrations are held in a large national database which uses a post code based retrieval system to locate cases geographically and link them to the underlying census enumeration districts, and hence to their populations at risk. Main outcome measures were comparison of observed/expected ratios (based on national rates) within bands delineated by concentric circles around point sources of environmental pollution located anywhere in Britain. MAIN RESULTS--The system is illustrated by a study of mortality from mesothelioma and asbestosis near the Plymouth naval dockyards during 1981-87. Within a 3 km radius of the docks the mortality rate for mesothelioma was higher than the national rate by a factor of 8.4, and that for asbestosis was higher by a factor of 13.6. CONCLUSIONS--SAHSU is a new national facility which is rapidly able to provide rates of mortality and cancer incidence for arbitrary circles drawn around any point in Britain. The example around Plymouth of mesothelioma and asbestosis demonstrates the ability of the system to detect an unusual excess of disease in a small locality, although in this case the findings are likely to be related to occupational rather than environmental exposure.},

  abstract = {Background Counties are the smallest unit for which mortality data are routinely available, allowing consistent and comparable long-term analysis of trends in health disparities. Average life expectancy has steadily increased in the United States but there is limited information on long-term mortality trends in the US counties This study aimed to investigate trends in county mortality and cross-county mortality disparities, including the contributions of specific diseases to county level mortality trends. Methods and Findings We used mortality statistics (from the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]) and population (from the US Census) to estimate sex-specific life expectancy for US counties for every year between 1961 and 1999. Data for analyses in subsequent years were not provided to us by the NCHS. We calculated different metrics of cross-county mortality disparity, and also grouped counties on the basis of whether their mortality changed favorably or unfavorably relative to the national average. We estimated the probability of death from specific diseases for counties with above- or below-average mortality performance. We simulated the effect of cross-county migration on each county's life expectancy using a time-based simulation model. Between 1961 and 1999, the standard deviation (SD) of life expectancy across US counties was at its lowest in 1983, at 1.9 and 1.4 y for men and women, respectively. Cross-county life expectancy SD increased to 2.3 and 1.7 y in 1999. Between 1961 and 1983 no counties had a statistically significant increase in mortality; the major cause of mortality decline for both sexes was reduction in cardiovascular mortality. From 1983 to 1999, life expectancy declined significantly in 11 counties for men (by 1.3 y) and in 180 counties for women (by 1.3 y); another 48 (men) and 783 (women) counties had nonsignificant life expectancy decline. Life expectancy decline in both sexes was caused by increased mortality from lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and a range of other noncommunicable diseases, which were no longer compensated for by the decline in cardiovascular mortality. Higher HIV/AIDS and homicide deaths also contributed substantially to life expectancy decline for men, but not for women. Alternative specifications of the effects of migration showed that the rise in cross-county life expectancy SD was unlikely to be caused by migration. Conclusions There was a steady increase in mortality inequality across the US counties between 1983 and 1999, resulting from stagnation or increase in mortality among the worst-off segment of the population. Female mortality increased in a large number of counties, primarily because of chronic diseases related to smoking, overweight and obesity, and high blood pressure.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo is a key computational tool in Bayesian statistics, but it can be challenging to monitor the convergence of an iterative stochastic algorithm. In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic \$\textbackslash widehat\{R\}\$ of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional \$\textbackslash widehat\{R\}\$ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

  abstract = {The availability of geographically indexed health and population data, with advances in computing, geographical information systems and statistical methodology, have opened the way for serious exploration of small area health statistics based on routine data. Such analyses may be used to address specific questions concerning health in relation to sources of pollution, to investigate clustering of disease or for hypothesis generation. We distinguish four types of analysis: disease mapping; geographic correlation studies; the assessment of risk in relation to a prespecified point or line source, and cluster detection and disease clustering. A general framework for the statistical analysis of small area studies will be considered. This framework assumes that populations at risk arise from inhomogeneous Poisson processes. Disease cases are then realizations of a thinned Poisson process where the risk of disease depends on the characteristics of the person, time and spatial location. Difficulties of analysis and interpretation due to data inaccuracies and aggregation will be addressed with particular reference to ecological bias and confounding. The use of errors-in-variables modelling in small area analyses will be discussed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Twenty-seven years (1990\textendash 2016) of cause-specific mortality data in British Columbia, Canada were linked to three demographic data sources. Bayesian small area estimation models were used to estimate life expectancy (LE) at birth and 20 cause-specific mortality rates by sex and year. The gaps in LE for males and females ranged from 6.9 years to 9.5 years with widening inequality in more recent years. Inequality ratios increased for almost all causes, especially for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections, maternal and neonatal disorders, and neoplasms.},
