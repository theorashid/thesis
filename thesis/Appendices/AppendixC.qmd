# Hex-cartogram of life expectancy in 2019 at the MSOA level {#sec-appC}

This is an alternative version of @fig-ch-4-map-level, using a hexagon-based cartogram where every MSOA has equal size. Hence, London, which has a lot of small MSOAs, takes up a larger proportion of the map. For an interactive version of the original figure, see the [visualisation](https://equitablehealthycities.org/focus-cities/london/mortality-map-england/).
