# Frequently Asked Questions {#sec-appA}

## How do I change the colors of links?

Pass in `urlcolor: ` in yaml. Or set these in the include-in-header file.

\noindent If you want to completely hide the links, you can use:

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{allcolors=.}!}, or even better: 

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{hidelinks}!}.

\noindent If you want to have obvious links in the PDF but not the printed text, use:

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{colorlinks=false}!}.
